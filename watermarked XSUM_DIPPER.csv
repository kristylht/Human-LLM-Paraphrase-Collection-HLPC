"Police said the 71-year-old was one of three men walking on Kells Avenue at about 08:25 BST.

"Lincolnshire Police is taking on about 150 officers over the next two years.
The force is restricting applications to people who have lived in the county for at least the past 12 months.
The county's Police and Crime Commissioner, Marc Jones, said the advert had attracted a great deal of interest.
In a statement on the force's website, Chief Constable Neil Rhodes said he wanted ""the force to reflect the community it serves and for applicants to have an understanding of the county and issues facing the public of Lincolnshire"".
The force said it would also consider applications from those with strong connections to the county, such as members of the armed forces who have left the region to work in other areas.
More on this and other local stories from across Lincolnshire
The application process opened on Monday.
One employment lawyer has described the force's policy as ""potentially discriminatory"".
Mary Walker, a partner at Andrew Jackson Solicitors and an expert in employment law, said the force would have to decide if the locals-only policy was ""proportionate"" and ""legitimate"".
""Does the need for that local knowledge outweigh the potential of discrimination on other potential recruits?"" she said.
Some other forces in England and Wales have a similar policy.

"Science teacher Simon Clarkson told the ATL annual conference the current system of controlled assessments simply asked students to ""jump through hoops"".
However, delegates did not feel the answer was to remove practicals from the A-level grades altogether.
New tougher A-levels are due to be taught from September 2015.
The exams regulator, Ofqual, has decided students taking new A-levels in chemistry, biology and physics will perform at least 12 practical experiments.
But these will be assessed as a pass or fail and will not count towards the A-level grade.
Instead, written exams at the end of the two year course will form 100% of the final grade.
Leading science organisations have already criticised the plan, arguing it will lead to practical work being ""de-prioritised"" in schools.
The resolution commits the ATL to lobby the new government after the election to overturn the decision: ""such that the assessment of practical work in science subjects as AS- and A-levels is included in the overall qualification grade.""
The proposer, Matt Mugan from Somerset, argued that overall, the new A-level system, which will separate AS-levels from the A2 qualification, would mean more students ""will fail"".
However Mr Clarkson, a physics teacher in a comprehensive academy in Leicestershire, said the practical work required under the current assessment system did little to develop students' problem solving and scientific skills.
He said that the plans for separate practical assessments would ""give us space to do some real science with our students"".
Geoff Pye, from Southend, said his school had switched to teaching iGCSEs in science instead of GCSEs to avoid having to prepare pupils ""to jump through artificial hoops"".
When it came to AS-level however, Mr Pye said he was required to get pupils ""to hoop jump rather than teaching them advanced skills with advanced equipment"".
The new system would allow the school to teach ""real practical science"", said Mr Pye.
In response Mr Mugan warned: ""If we reject this motion, we're effectively lying down and saying A-level reform is okay.""
Another speaker, Matt Surman, warned that the union had already adopted the reversal of A-level reforms as policy.
On Monday, ATL general secretary, Mary Bousted criticised the exams regulator for not being prepared to engage with debate and uncertainty in ignoring the concerns of the science community over its plans for assessing practical skills at A-level and GCSE.","The ""Mickey-Mouse practicals"" students do under the current A-level system, have nothing to do with ""real science"", a teaching union conference has heard.","we are going to have to make more cuts to the education budget, Science teacher Simon Clarkson said.

In contrast to positive responses, some users expressed confusion while others ridiculed the message.

"American Troy Bradley and Russian Leonid Tiukhtyaev landed safely, their Two Eagles Balloon team said.
They claim to have beaten the world distance and duration records by flying for more than 137 hours and travelling more than 5,209 miles (8,383km).
To set the records the team needed to beat the existing records by 1%.
""The Two Eagles balloon team is pleased to report the Two Eagles balloon has landed safely just off the Baja coast near La Poza Grande,"" their team said in a statement.
""The pilots made a controlled descent to a gentle water landing about four miles off the Baja coast. The balloon is stable and still inflated and the pilots are fine.""
The two pilots left Japan on Sunday and had aimed to land in Canada or the US. However, weather forced them to change course towards Mexico.
They were met in the sea by a Mexican fishing boat.
The statement stressed that the sea landing was acceptable ""under the international rules governing the establishment of world records"".
""Two around-the-world attempts using a different type of balloon landed in the water and were approved as records.""
The two pilots needed to beat the existing records - both set in 1981 - by 1%.
For duration that meant staying aloft for about 138 hours and 45 minutes, and for distance they needed to travel about 5,260 miles.
The Two Eagles Balloon team said the landing ""occurred at six days, 16 hours and 37 minutes"", with the pilots covering the distance of 6,646 miles.
Gas-air balloons are difficult to steer, relying on the differing wind speed and direction at different altitudes.
In order to change height the pilots have only a helium release valve to go down and sandbags to jettison to go up.
The hi-tech ""Two Eagles"" balloon is made of a strong Kevlar and carbon-fibre composite, but weighs only 220 pounds (100kg).
It is fitted with monitors and other instruments that track their course and compile data to be submitted to record-keepers.
The specially-designed capsule sits beneath a huge helium-filled envelope and is designed to stay aloft for up to 10 days. The pilots live in a closet-like space with a very low ceiling.","Two pilots in a helium balloon have completed their crossing of the Pacific with a sea-landing off Mexico, setting new milestones on a six-day trip.",two men were flying near the island of Ternopil in the Barents Sea when they saw a bright light.

"RamJam uploaded Southern Rail Tycoon on Thursday, and so far 45,000 people have played the tongue-in-cheek game.
The aim is to stop guards from boarding trains, which leads to services being cancelled as profits are collected from passengers.
It was inspired by months of cancellations due to an RMT dispute.
Once a sufficient number of train guards board on a train and a delayed service eventually departs, the player loses the game.
Brighton-based developer Tom Jackson said: ""We all were planning to go to London a month ago and trains were delayed, then delayed, then delayed and then eventually cancelled.
""We were so frustrated by the whole thing that we've stopped using the trains.""
Mr Jackson, along with his colleagues Phil Hart and Toby Funnell, developed the game as a result of that experience.
The 39-year-old said that the purpose of the game was a mixture of providing commuters with something fun to do while waiting for delayed trains and also making people aware of the compensation policy.
When the game is over, links appear to the Southern Rail compensation page and twitter account.
He added: ""We like to do pieces that are reactive and demonstrate the impact [news events] have on people.
""It's incredibly frustrating, the train service is an absolute shambles.""
A Southern Rail spokesman said: ""Southern makes no money by cancelling trains - in fact the opposite is true.
""We are trying hard to give passengers the best service possible under very difficult circumstances and apologise sincerely.""
The RMT union and GTR are in a dispute regarding the proposed introduction of more driver-only operated (DOO) services, which would change conductors' roles.
As a result of regular walkouts, Southern cancelled 341 daily train services on 11 July to improve ""reliability"". Since then 15 have been reinstated.
Rail minister Claire Perry resigned on Friday as a result of the months of delays on the line, managed by Govia Thameslink Railway.
On Monday, new Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said resolving the strike action was ""top of his priority list"".",Web developers frustrated by months of delays on Southern Rail have used their experience as inspiration for an online game which lampoons the company.,.

"Halfpenny's contract at Toulon ends in summer 2016, with Cardiff Blues reported to be interested in re-signing the player.
The 26-year-old left the Blues for France in the summer of 2014.
""He's no different to anyone else. If he is serious about returning we'd be interested to talk to him,"" said Pivac.
""We don't have an endless budget, but I've said it earlier and nothing has changed.
""If there's any returning Welsh players we'd like to have the opportunity to talk to them just to check what's going on in the market-place and find out their value.""
It is likely any return to Wales by the 2013 British and Irish Lions full-back would be on a national dual contract funded 60% by the Welsh Rugby Union.
Under the terms of the agreement between the four regions and the WRU, the player's region of origin would have first refusal on a player returning to Wales - suggesting the Blues would be favourites.
However, flanker Dan Lydiate opted for Ospreys ahead of his old region Newport Gwent Dragons when he returned to Wales from Racing 92.
Another factor could be whether Halfpenny could join a region that qualifies for the 2016-17 European Champions Cup.
Scarlets and Ospreys are Wales' representatives in this season's tournament, and the Blues will have to show a marked improvement in their Pro12 form to qualify for next season.
With Halfpenny having won the tournament with Toulon last season, the chance to play in Europe's premier club event could be a major lure.
After watching his side beat Zebre 20-12 in the Pro12, Pivac also said the Scarlets are keen to hold on to club captain Scott Williams.
The Wales centre - like Halfpenny - is currently out of action after surgery.
Williams is already on a dual contract, which runs out in the summer of 2016.
""I know he's contracted until the end of the season and hopefully we'll get some rugby out of him in that time,"" said Pivac.
""There's lots of things happening behind the scenes at the moment and I'm not really in a position to give you anything that hasn't already been given out in a press release.

""It's a case of waiting to see what happens,"" Burton told BBC Shropshire.
""There are a lot of lads out of contract here, because a lot signed two years ago,"" added 19-year-old Burton.
Speculation has previously linked him with Wolves, Aston Villa and even Glasgow Rangers.
But Newport-born Burton has witnessed the route to the top taken by England's number one, fellow Shropshire lad Joe Hart, who did a full season as Shrewsbury keeper a decade ago.
""I've grown up watching the club,"" he said. ""I want to stay and play for the team as much as I can. We will have to see what happens to everyone.

"Hanjin's board unanimously agreed to make the court filing at a meeting on Wednesday, a company spokesman said.
It faces a cash shortage after failing to persuade key lenders to reschedule debt under a new restructuring plan.
Shares of Hanjin remain suspended in Seoul after plunging by as much as 29% on Tuesday.
Hanjin, which is also the world's seventh-largest container line, has been unprofitable for four of the last five years.
Hanjin may get some financial relief courtesy of rival Hyundai Merchant Marine (HMM).
Shares of HMM jumped by as much as 22% after Korea's financial regulator said the firm may buy some of Hanjin's assets.
However HMM hasn't been spared from the woes bedevilling the sector. It recently announced a reorganisation plan too.
South Korea's shipping and shipbuilding industry is one of the hardest-hit by a prolonged downturn in global trade.

"The Very Reverend Martin Thrower, 56, rector of Hadleigh, Suffolk, held his mobile phone over the top of a toilet cubicle, Norwich Crown Court heard.
Thrower was arrested at a shopping centre in Ipswich in August 2016.
He admitted two counts of voyeurism at a previous hearing and his sentence was suspended for 24 months.
Thrower was ordered to complete a 60-day course to address sex offending behaviour, and must attend a further 30-day rehabilitation course.
William Carter, prosecuting, said the rector was caught when a 17-year-old heard a noise above him as he sat on the toilet at the Buttermarket shopping centre.
The teenager saw someone's hand holding a mobile phone that was filming him over the cubicle partition. He grabbed the phone and Thrower was arrested.
Passing sentence earlier, judge Katharine Moore told Thrower he had been ""well-regarded"" by those he had helped, adding he had been a listening ear ""in times of great sadness and some in happier times"".
She told him: ""It seems to me that there has been a tendency throughout to attribute this persistent behaviour over a two-year period to a breakdown in your mental health.
""I accept without reservation that you were working very hard.
""I do not accept that your actions here though were anything other than an exercise of free choice repeated again and again when you thought you could get away with it in public lavatories.""
When Thrower was arrested, officers found three further videos recorded on the phone that day, including of two men who had not noticed they were being filmed.
Thrower, of Church Street, Hadleigh, Suffolk, is rector of Hadleigh, Layham and Shelley.
He has been suspended from all roles by the Diocese of St Edmundsbury in Ipswich.

"Colin Capp, 23, of Scotland, attacked Darren Thomas, 45, while he slept in their cell on Wing B.
Consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Melanie Croy told the jury Mr Capp's ability to form rational judgement was impaired because of his mental illness.
Mr Capp admits killing Mr Thomas but denies murder.
Appearing for the defence, Dr Croy, who works at Ashworth high security hospital where Mr Capp has been detained, said he suffered from an abnormality of mental function, which could diminish his responsibility for Mr Thomas's murder.
Dr Croy told the court Mr Capp suffered from paranoid delusional beliefs and heard two voices in his head.
One, which he describes as Mr Grey, tells him to harm others and himself, the jury was told.
Since he has been at Ashworth hospital, Mr Capp has described voices telling him to kill others with his bare hands, she said.
A second female voice acts as a guardian and gives him advice, the court was told.
Mr Capp told Dr Croy he believed he was being tortured at Cardiff prison in the weeks leading to the killing and thought he was going to be killed.
A different consultant psychiatrist, on behalf of the prosecution, believes Mr Capp has a personality disorder rather than a mental illness.
Dr Phillip Joseph told the jury he believed Mr Capp understood what he was doing when he killed his cellmate.
MrThomas was discovered dead in the cell with a plastic bag wrapped around his head. He had been stabbed 100 times in the neck with a ball point pen.
Mr Capp denies murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

Kompany was instrumental as City took the lead, pressuring Giorgio Chiellini into turning the ball into his own net.
However, he sustained a calf injury as the Italians fought back to win 2-1.
""We will have to see how Vincent is on Wednesday,"" said City manager Manuel Pellegrini. ""We will check and see how serious the injury is.""
Kompany, 29, was replaced by Nicolas Otamendi - City's ¬£32.5m signing from Valencia - after Mario Mandzukic equalised for Juve, with Alvaro Morata scoring the winner nine minutes from time.
Pellegrini was also unable to start with striker Sergio Aguero after he sustained a knee injury early in the win at Crystal Palace on Saturday, although the Argentina international did make a seven-minute appearance as a substitute after City went behind.
""He was not fit to play 90 minutes,"" said Pellegrini. ""It was a risk and I tried not to use him in case he got a kick in the same place.""
It was a familiar tale for City - who have yet to win an opening Champions League home game in five attempts in the group stage - but Pellegrini is confident they can still make the last 16.
Their next two games are trips to face German side Borussia Monchengladbach and Spain's reigning Europa League winners Sevilla.
The Chilean, who is 62 on Wednesday, said: ""We have 15 more points to play for, so it depends on how we play and what result we get in our next game.
""It is not the best way to start to lose at home to such a strong team in the group as Juventus.
""But this has happened to us before and it doesn't mean we are not going to qualify.""
Raheem Sterling was the chief culprit, missing an early chance, then another with City leading 1-0, but Pellegrini said: ""I don't think I need to talk about Raheem Sterling. We controlled the game.
""It was a strange game and I don't think we deserved to lose it. I thought we played better than Juventus but they are a strong team.

"West Yorkshire Police confirmed last month that 16,000 tickets issued by police community support officers (PCSO) were not valid due because of an ""administrative error"".
But, the force said there was ""no basis in law"" for refunds, which would have ""come from the public purse"".
Many of the drivers paid up without challenging the ticket's validity.
After a review of PCSO powers in March, the force found some PCSOs who joined the force several years ago were not initially given powers to issue parking tickets.
In a statement, police said ""an administrative error meant that the authorisation was invalid"".
The force's current records system, which goes back to 2006, found 16,000 tickets were affected, resulting in total of ¬£485,000 being paid to the courts.
The force admitted other tickets may have been issued in similar circumstances for up to three years earlier.
It said it had taken legal advice on the matter.
A spokesman said: ""We are now satisfied that there is no basis in law that would entitle anyone to such a refund, which would in any case have had to come from the public purse.
At the heart of this assessment is that motorists had opportunity to challenge the validity of the process in court at the time, and only those found guilty in these circumstances were penalised.
""If, however, motorists elected to pay the penalty they effectively accepted having committed the offence and opted out of the court process, thereby waiving their right to contest the matter.""
The force said the ""anomaly"" had since been corrected and PCSOs now had the full powers to issue the fines.","Nearly ¬£500,000 worth of wrongly-issued parking fines will not be refunded, police have said.",: The Home Office has advised local forces to make the following changes.

"The IPCC said South Yorkshire Police did not take seriously claims Watkins had been sharing indecent images.
It said three officers would have faced misconduct hearings over their inaction but that all three had since retired.
Watkins was jailed for 35 years in 2013 after admitting 13 child sex offences.
More stories from across Yorkshire
South Yorkshire Police said it accepted the findings and admitted its handling of the matter was ""far below the standard the public or we as a service would expect"".
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said South Yorkshire Police were asked in March 2012 by colleagues in South Wales to meet Watkins' ex-girlfriend Joanne Mjadzelics after she made allegations that he had sent her an indecent image.
It said the request was initially wrongly allocated to its Safer Neighbourhoods team rather than the Public Protection Unit and, when Ms Mjadzelics produced her computer, the untrained officer neither viewed the image nor seized the device.
Two months later, on 3 May, Ms Mjadzelics took her computer to Doncaster police station again and again it was not seized.
Officers did not view the image until 11 May but concluded it was of an adult female and destroyed the laptop before Watkins was eventually arrested.
The IPCC launched an investigation into the force's handling of the allegations after Ms Mjadzelics complained officers had not examined her laptop properly, and that an officer had used inappropriate language towards her.
IPCC commissioner Jan Williams said: ""Having taken into consideration the nature and seriousness of Ms Mjadzelics' allegations against Watkins, the inaction of some South Yorkshire police officers involved may have placed a child at risk of further abuse for several months.
""The evidence suggests there was a general view among officers at Doncaster that Ms Mjadzelics was not to be taken seriously, and consequently inquiries were not progressed as they should have been.""
Assistant Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police David Hartley said: ""Our handling of this matter fell far below the standard the public or we as a service would expect, and I would like to offer my sincere apologies to Ms Mjadzelics as she received a service that was unacceptable with no support.""
Watkins, from Pontypridd, pleaded guilty at Cardiff Crown Court to 13 child sex offences, including the attempted rape of a baby.

"Chief Inspector of Prisons Peter Clarke published his findings following unannounced inspections.
Challenges included staff shortages and increased use of new psychoactive substances, leading to more ""unpredictable and violent behaviour"".
But inspectors also found good staff-prisoner relationships and a ""good range"" of training and education.
Despite safety declining since 2013, Mr Clarke described it as a ""mixed picture of progress"".
There were 770 inmates at the time of the inspections in July and August, despite the Certified Normal Accommodation (CNA) level - how many prisoners can be held safely and decently - being 532.
Other positives in the report included an improvement in resettling prisoners after release, but it found some cells were in a poor state and there was a lack of bedding.
The report said: ""Despite these challenges, it did not feel unstable and staff-prisoner relationships had been maintained.""
Head of the National Offender Management Service, Michael Spurr, said: ""Despite significant operational pressures the prison has continued to deliver a positive regime with good levels of purposeful activity and effective support of prisoners before release.""
But campaign group, the Howard League for Penal Reform, described it as an ""overcrowded and understaffed prison where it is easy to get drugs but much harder to get clean bedding"".
The recently-introduced smoking ban was described as ""unpopular with some"".
Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League, said: ""This inspection report on Cardiff prison is slightly better than reports on other prisons which we have seen of late, but still it raises considerable cause for concern.""
Responding to the report, Cardiff Central MP Jo Stevens said: ""This report makes clear that there are huge areas of concern for Cardiff prison and these can be added to the long list of wake up calls to the Prisons Minister.

"Fewer animals were counted on Scotland's east coast and in Orkney in surveys by St Andrews University Sea Mammal Research Unit.
But the work commissioned by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), found an increase in harbour seals on the west coast.
Between Cape Wrath and Ullapool, 1,095 animals were recorded.
In 2008, a survey counted 2,687.

"This Is For My Girls was written by Diane Warren - whose previous credits include I Don't Want To Miss A Thing and Un-Break My Heart.
She described the song - a strident, girl power anthem - as ""We Are the World meets Lady Marmalade"".
Obama released the single ahead of her keynote speech at the SXSW festival.
She will talk about her Let Girls Learn initiative, which is aimed at boosting education rates amongst adolescent girls around the world.
Several of the performers on the track, including Missy Elliott and Diane Warren, will then join her on a panel about the initiative, as well as Sophia Bush and Queen Latifah, who will moderate the discussion.
This Is For My Girls combines jazzy horn stabs with a propulsive drum beat, giving the song a militaristic feel.
The lyrics mostly comprise generic statements of empowerment - ""Don't take nothing from nobody""; ""It's all about respect""; ""Stand strong forever"" - which have been a standard component of female-fronted R&B since the turn of the millennium.
Other vocalists featured on the track include Janelle Monae, Glee actress Lea Michele, Disney star Zendaya, 16-year-old Motown artist Jadagrace, and Beyonce proteges Chloe & Halle.
All of the artists waived their fees, meaning proceeds will go directly to the Let Girls Learn campaign.
""We haven't had an anthem like this in a while,"" Warren told Billboard.
""I envisioned the record being with all these different women, never just one girl singing on it.
""With Kelly Rowland on it, it's almost like an updated Destiny's Child record. I think it can be a huge worldwide anthem. I hope it becomes that.""

"World heavyweight champion Fury, 27, who expressed views on women, abortion and homosexuality, has been asked to attend a meeting in the new year.
The BBBofC met to discuss the matter on Wednesday before informing Fury that he must meet with the board.
The Briton has denied he is a homophobe and claimed he is ""uniting the world"".
No exact date has been confirmed for the meeting.
Meanwhile, Fury will not face police action following an inquiry into alleged homophobic comments.
Greater Manchester Police (GMP) received a complaint earlier this week after statements made on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.
But the force has recorded the comments as a ""hate incident"" as opposed to a hate crime.
In the aftermath of his win against Ukrainian Wladimir Klitschko in Dusseldorf, Fury had said: ""I'm not sexist. I believe a woman's best place is in the kitchen and on her back. That's my personal belief. Making me a good cup of tea, that's what I believe.""
The new world champion has also previously said it would only take the legalisation of paedophilia in addition to the decriminalisation of homosexuality and abortion to see ""the devil come home"".
The Manchester fighter subsequently said: ""Tyson Fury loves his fellow humans. He doesn't hate anybody.""
Fellow BBC Sports Personality of the Year nominee and long jump champion Greg Rutherford had planned to withdraw from this year's event over Fury's comments, before reversing his decision.
Fury, who won the WBA, IBF and WBO titles on 28 November by beating Klitschko, was stripped of the IBF belt on Tuesday after choosing to face Klitschko in a rematch instead of the IBF's mandatory challenger, Ukrainian Vyacheslav Glazkov.",Tyson Fury has been summoned by the British Boxing Board of Control to explain his recent controversial comments.,"British Boxing Board of Control (BBBoC) said it was concerned about the ""lack of clarity"" around Fury's views on women, abortion","""The British Boxing Board of Control (BBBoC) said it was concerned that there was a lack of clarity on Fury's views on women,",It was noted that the British Boxing Board of Control was troubled by the lack of clarity about Fury’s feelings about women. ,The British Boxing Board of Control had complained of a lack of clarity over Fury's feelings about women. ,The British Boxing Board had complained that Fury had had no idea about women's feelings. ,A report had been filed by the British Boxing Board stating that Fury had no idea of women’s feelings. ,"is not obliged to attend and could turn down the invitation.

"Ashley Broomhall trekked to the summit of 3,560ft (1,085m) Snowdon in Snowdonia before tackling Ben Nevis.
It took him seven hours to walk up and down the 4,406ft (1,344m) Scottish peak near Fort William. On the way up he had a snowball fight with other walkers.
He now plans to walk 3,208ft (978m) Scafell Pike in the Lake District.
Mr Broomhall, from Whitchurch in Shropshire, has been doing the walks to raise money for Cancer Research UK.
He set himself the peaks challenge after his mother was diagnosed with cancer.
The 28-year-old has been a member of Star Wars costuming club the 501st UK Garrison for more than five years.
Members attend events across the UK dressed in ""movie-accurate"" costumes to raise funds for charity.
But Mr Broomhall had to make some modifications to his outfit to make it move more freely on the ascents and descents of Snowdon and Ben Nevis, which were done this summer.
For safety reasons, he wore walking boots because his costume footwear was not suitable for the terrain involved and was accompanied by friends.
Dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper and carrying a UK Garrison flag, Mr Broomhall said he drew more than his fair share of funny looks tackling Ben Nevis, Scotland highest Munro and Britain's tallest mountain.
He said: ""We had been confusing a lot of other climbers along the way as a stormtrooper was the last thing they had been expecting to see climbing Ben Nevis.
""We handed out cards and told them my tale and they offered nothing but the most vocal support.""
Mr Broomhall also received donations from other walkers.
Higher up Ben Nevis he had to negotiate thigh-deep snow.
At the first of these snowfields there was some light relief when he and his walking companion had a snowball fight with other walkers.
Mr Broomhall said: ""The last snowfield held the summit and, with my heart swelling with pride, I let the flag fly and charged on to the summit.
""We had made it. It was brilliant and I was so happy at making it after all the struggles and rallying needed to get myself there.
""I was greeted by a cheer from the climbers there and planted the flag on the summit itself claiming it for the Empire.""
He added: ""I love Scotland and I love Munros and this was a challenge that I enjoyed doing.

"The firm plans to introduce a new fleet of 52 driver-only-operated (DOO) trains from 2020.
None of the permanent guards or guard managers would be forced to quit their employment, the company said.
RMT union said it was in formal dispute with Merseyrail and its 220 members would be balloted for strike action.
John Tilley, of RMT, said Merseyrail had failed to give cast iron assurances on the future of 220 guards and managers at a meeting on Wednesday, and he ""fully expected"" members to vote heavily for industrial action.
RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ""We will not agree to any extensions of DOO and will fight to retain the safety critical role of the guard and to keep a guard on the train.""
He said the train operator had ""snubbed"" a final chance to avoid the ballot.
He added it was ""entirely preventable if the company had listened to the union's deep-seated safety concerns... and had put passenger safety before profit"".
Merseyrail said it had ""made it clear"" that it will look after guards and management whose roles would no longer exist once the new fleet is introduced and there would be no compulsory redundancies.
The train operator said the RMT had demanded there should be a guard on every new train but the new fleet had been designed to operate without guards, and as such, it was not in a position to guarantee this.

"It was announced on Wednesday that the East Midlands Congenital Heart Centre, at Glenfield Hospital, was to stop children's surgery services.
It was one of 10 units under review nationally with the intention to focus expertise in fewer locations.
The charity Heartlink said it would not accept the judgement.
A spokesman for the charity, John Rigby, said: ""We're going to take stock, listen to what our reps have to say and be guided by them. We're going to fight to do our very best to keep children's services here [at Glenfield].""
The centre, which conducts about 230 operations on children and 70 on adults each year, has the UK's largest ECMO unit (a form of partial cardiopulmonary bypass) which oxygenates blood of critically ill patients.
The unit will stop surgery for children but will remain open to diagnose patients and for monitoring and non-surgical treatment.
It serves a population of about five million, with the next nearest similar unit in Birmingham, about 40 miles (64.4km) away.
Leslie Hamilton, vice chair of the Safe and Sustainable review's steering group, said that as surgeons they felt surgical expertise was spread too thinly around the country.
He said: ""We felt we had to concentrate the expertise and reduce the number of centres in the country so we could have bigger centres with bigger surgical teams.
""That would lead to sustainable care for the future and also a big improvement in care.""
Tony Fowlston has a three-year-old son, Lewis, who has been treated at Glenfield. The family travels a distance of about 60 miles (96.5km) from Boston, in Lincolnshire, to see specialists.
He said travelling any further could be a real issue as Lewis recently suffered a cardiac arrest shortly after arriving at Glenfield.
Mr Fowlston said: ""He could have had that cardiac arrest on the way to, say, Birmingham. Could he have had the same service in the back of an ambulance? I very much doubt it.""

"Hina Rabbani Khar's remarks came hours after the two armies agreed to ""de-escalate"" tensions after a meeting of their chiefs of operations.
Tensions have risen following deadly exchanges along the border last week.
The violence has plunged the neighbours into the worst crisis in relations since the Mumbai attacks of 2008, blamed on militants based in Pakistan.
""Instead of issuing belligerent statements by the military and political leaders from across the border and ratcheting up tension, it is advisable for the two countries to discuss all concerns related to Line of Control (LoC) with a view to reinforcing respect for the ceasefire,"" Ms Khar's office said.
AFP news agency quotes her as saying that the recent border clashes had ""created questions"" and added that Pakistan was ""open"" to dialogue between foreign ministers to end the dispute.
India has not commented on Ms Khar's remarks so far.
On Wednesday the Pakistani army's director of military operations agreed to the de-escalation after calling his Indian counterpart to ""protest strongly"" a ""ceasefire violation"" by Indian soldiers that killed a Pakistani soldier along the LoC on Tuesday night.
India has denied the allegation, which comes after separate incidents last week, in which two Indian soldiers and two Pakistani soldiers died.
The Pakistani commander said strict orders had been passed to troops on the LoC to observe a ceasefire that has been in place since 2003, a spokesman for the Indian army, Col Jagdeep Dahiya, told the BBC.
Both sides deny provoking the clashes, amid fears that a fledgling peace process under way since last February could unravel, says the BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi.
On Tuesday, Indian PM Manmohan Singh said the killing of the Indian soldiers last week - one of whom India says was beheaded - was ""unacceptable"".

"Cormack, a former chief executive of Aberdeen, sold his software company for ¬£630m last year.
""I can offer both financial support and my time to the club,"" Cormack told the Aberdeen website.
""I look forward to attracting American investment and strategic partnerships [to] help AFC maximise its potential.""
Cormack will work with existing board members, including chairman Stewart Milne, while splitting his time between Atlanta and the north east of Scotland.
The 58-year-old was interim chief executive of the Pittodrie club between 2000 and 2001 during a sabbatical from his business interests in the USA.
He is seeking to ""work with the management team at AFC to explore some innovative ideas I've seen work Stateside"".
Cormack returns to the club after selling the software company that he helped to grow from a firm employing 12 people in 2004 to a 500-strong workforce, generating ¬£107m in annual revenues, in 2016.
""While I have continued to support and provide advice to the club for many years, I'm honoured to be back on the board,"" Cormack said.
""The club's performance in recent seasons, both on and off the pitch, is a testament to how hard everyone at Pittodrie has worked.

""I'm looking forward to working with the existing leadership team at the club, with whom I've already got a great relationship.
""Between us, and with the support of our fans, I'm sure we can get the club into a position where increased revenues, an expanded fanbase, and a state-of the-art community stadium and training campus will position AFC well to exploit changes that evolve in European club competition.""

"Investigators think the blast was caused by a female suicide bomber from the Islamic State group.
Correspondents say Turkey is cracking down on the militants, after previously being accused of ignoring them.
But the blast triggered violent protest in Istanbul, with police using water cannon, teargas and rubber bullets.
Friday's bomb hit a group of youth activists planning to cross into Syria to help rebuild the town of Kobane.
A video shows the group holding a news conference to discuss their plans, when an explosion rips through the young people - mostly of university age - gathered in the grounds of a cultural centre.
They had been chanting slogans and were holding a large banner with the words ""We defended it together, we are building it together.""
Kobane is just across the border from Suruc and has been the site of fierce fighting between IS and Kurdish fighters.
It was retaken by the Kurds in January. Suruc houses many refugees who have fled the fighting in Kobane.
Kobane: Inside the town devastated by fight against IS
The attack took place just before noon local time (09:00 GMT). Around a hundred people were injured.
Mr Davutoglu said initial findings suggested it was the work of IS.
""Turkey has taken and will continue to take all necessary measures against Islamic State,"" Mr Davutoglu told a news conference in Ankara.
""We are face to face with a terrorism incident. We have the willpower to find and certainly punish those who are responsible.""
""Measures on our border with Syria... will be increased,"" he added.
BBC Middle East correspondent Jim Muir says Turkey has been widely accused of turning a blind eye to IS activities, but recently it has been cracking down harder on the militants and this may be one reason for the attack.
The country's leaders seem likely to toughen their line even further in its wake, he adds.
There were large scale demonstrations in cities across the country.
Protests in Istanbul and Ankara turned violent as police clashed with protesters.
A witness told the Reuters news agency that hundreds of protesters in Istanbul chanted slogans accusing Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of collaboration with IS.
Earlier in the day, the president condemned the attack.
""On behalf of my people, I curse and condemn the perpetrators of this brutality,"" he said while visiting Cyprus. ""Terror must be condemned no matter where it comes from.""
A spokesman for the White House condemned the attack and expressed ""solidarity with the Turkish government and the Turkish people"".","Turkish PM Ahmet Davutoglu has promised to boost security along the country's border with Syria, after 30 people were killed by a bomb in the town of Suruc.","Associated Press reported that the suicide bomber was a woman, and that she detonated herself at a police station.

"An RAF Voyager A330 air-to-air refuelling aircraft will be refitted at a cost of about ¬£10m.
The government says the move will save about ¬£775,000 a year as the plane will be cheaper than chartering flights.
The SNP's Stewart Hosie said there needed to be ""absolute transparency"" to ensure the ""best deal is made on behalf of the tax-payer"".
""This announcement comes just a week before the spending review when we can expect to hear of more cuts from the Tories, which are already hitting people hard,"" he added.
Most government departments are facing budget cuts of at least 25% over the next four years.
A source said the PM's flights, using either Royal Squadron planes or long haul charter, cost on average ¬£6,700 per flying hour and the RAF aircraft would cost ¬£2,000. It would be available for refuelling when it wasn't in use.
The flight would also be available to the Royal family.
When he was prime minister, Gordon Brown cancelled plans drawn up by his predecessor Tony Blair to buy two private jets, which had been nicknamed ""Blair Force One"" in reference to the aircraft used to fly the US president, Air Force One.

There is no definite timing for the plane to come into service but it could be as early as next year.
A government spokesperson said;  ""As part of the government's defence review, we have been looking at ways to make better use of the RAF fleet to transport senior ministers and consequently deliver savings for taxpayers.

"The 19 year-old added 85 for the first wicket with Paul Horton (41) before Glamorgan claimed three quick wickets, two to teenager Lukas Carey.
Dearden then dominated a stand of 90 with Mark Pettini (63 not out) before being bowled by spinner Andrew Salter.
Pettini steered the Foxes to a second batting point underneath the lights.
Dearden, who was dropped on one, survived a couple of run-out chances in his lengthy vigil of 211 balls.
But it was a gritty performance from the home team after being put in to bat, in a battle of two teams who had lost their opening two fixtures by large margins.
Salter claimed a second wicket, bowling Cameron Delport for 20, before Pettini and Lewis Hill accelerated against the new ball in a stand of 73.
Leicestershire batsman Harry Dearden told BBC Radio Leicester:
""I was very proud to get a career-best, I would have loved to have got to three figures but still very proud, it's been a really good day for us.
""It was doing a bit early on, nipping around and swinging, you've just got to take as many balls as you can to get in and it was a good battle up top.
""I just tried to knuckle down and be as disciplined as I could. It's good batting with Horts (Paul Horton), he's an experienced head and calms you down, and it's really good batting with Mark (Pettini), he keeps you level.""
Glamorgan spinner Andrew Salter told BBC Wales Sport:
""I am happy to take those two wickets, though it won't come as a surprise that they didn't turn that much- one through the gate and one a bit fuller that hit a bit of rough.
""It was more about trying to control the run-rate and I felt that if I built enough pressure there'd be some reward at the end of it, so hopefully I won't be needed too much more in the first innings.

"It was the first time the Commonwealth gold medallist had fought in front of his home crowd at a packed Meadowbank.
""I didn't think it would be as quick as that,"" Taylor told BBC Scotland.
""This boy is very special,"" said manager Barry McGuigan. We've got to take the right fights at the right time.""
The Hungarian Mate came into the contest with an impressive record with 17 wins in his 22 previous fights, but it was evident from the first bell that Taylor was more than a match for him.
Taylor burst out of the corner and had Mate on the canvass with only 45 seconds on the clock.
And when the Commonwealth Games champion caught Mate with a left hook to floor him for the second time the referee stepped in to stop him enduring any further punishment with only 85 seconds of the first round gone.
The speed of victory caught Taylor by surprise who expected a stern test in front of his home crowd.
""It was a pretty hostile atmosphere and when I seen him in the centre of the ring I could see it in his eyes that he was a wee bit scared.
""I thought he would have come out a bit more but I caught him with a good shot and I felt that I was stronger than him.""
Taylor is managed by the former world champion Barry McGuigan who said there was little learned during the fight that they didn't already know about his boxer.
""It was a pretty pointless exercise in one sense because Josh didn't get the sort of rounds we were expecting. But he is a tremendous puncher and and that guy (Mate) went down and wasn't getting up there is no doubt about it.""
McGuigan says they will now need to look for a tougher opponent next time around.
""We know the calibre that Josh is but I am now thinking where are we going to go now. We need to get guys that are even better (than Mate) and just get him out again.""
Taylor says he wants to be back in the ring before the end of the year before he will even contemplate looking at any potential title fights.
""I hope to be back in the ring before Christmas. I will only take a couple of days off before getting back into training, learning and developing.""

You know when you don't want to do something but you have to?
As soon as Valencia thundered through the back of Saucedo, referee Allen Chapman knew he had to act.
Chapman - whose previous claim to fame was being the first video assistant referee to make an actual decision during a United States Soccer League game in 2016 - first looked warily at Jose Mourinho. Then, after making sure the injured player was being taken care of, he walked over to the United manager.
Please take Valencia off, requested Chapman, aware dismissing a United player in a friendly would create a stir.

"The Rhodesian Squadron Royal Air Force plane, based at RAF Wittering, crashed at Holme on 22 November 1940.
Pilot Officer Harold Penketh, from Brighton, did not bail out and died.
The Spitfire remains were found after a geophysical survey of the area. It is hoped the recovered parts will be put on public display.
The cause of the crash was never fully established, although witnesses said the Mk 1A Spitfire X4583 broke formation and nose-dived into farmland in the village of Holme, south of Peterborough.
An investigation concluded either the pilot's oxygen system failed or there was a physical failure of the plane.
Pilot Officer Penketh, 20, made no attempt to use his parachute. His body was recovered from the wreckage and returned to his family.
The ""enormous crater"" created by the Spitfire quickly filled with water as the water table in the area is high, eyewitness John Bliss, who was a child at the time, said.
The spitfire remains have lain in their watery grave for 75 years.
The crash site was located after a geophysical survey and metal detecting carried out by Cranfield University in August.
The excavation, which started on Monday and is expected to take a week, is being led by Oxford Archaeology East.
The remains, which are still the property of the Ministry of Defence, will be cleaned and documented. Some are expected to be put on display later this month.
Following the excavation, the land will be restored to a mix of fenland habitats and managed as part of the Great Fen reserve by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire.",A Spitfire that crashed in Cambridgeshire while on a training mission during World War Two is to be dug up by archaeologists.,"co-pilot, Captain J.

"Rehtaeh Parsons, 17, of Nova Scotia, killed herself in April after being taunted over a photo of her alleged rape by four boys, her mother has said.
Two 18-year-old men were arrested on Thursday in connection with the photograph.
The men, who have not been named, will be prosecuted in a juvenile court.
""We hope that today's arrests help the community to heal,"" Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Chief Superintendent Roland Wells of the Halifax district said in a statement on Thursday evening.
""A young girl has died in what was a tragic set of circumstances. We all need to reflect on how we as a community can come together in Rehtaeh's memory and see what we can do to work together to support our youth.""
One of the men was charged with two counts of distribution of child pornography, the other with one count each of making child pornography and distribution of child pornography.
The RCMP said the names of the accused would not be released because they were youths at the time of the alleged offence, and warned Halifax residents who believe they know the identities of the accused not to release them on penalty of prosecution, nor to take vigilante action.
According to Rehtaeh's mother Leah Parsons, the Nova Scotia teen went to a party in 2011, when she was 15, and became inebriated after drinking vodka.
The girl told her parents that while she was heavily intoxicated, she was raped by four boys, and someone took a photograph of it.
The photograph was circulated online, and soon her schoolmates began taunting her over the photograph. The bullying was incessant, her mother said.
""She was never left alone,"" Ms Parsons told CBC News in April after Rehtaeh's suicide.
""Her friends turned against her, people harassed her, boys she didn't know started texting her and Facebooking asking her to have sex with them since she had had sex with their friends. It just never stopped.""
Rehtaeh died in April in hospital, several days after attempting suicide.
Police at first said they did not have grounds to make any arrests in connection with the alleged rape or the photograph. The investigation was reopened in April after police said they received new information.",Two men have been charged with child pornography crimes in the alleged cyber-bullying of a teenaged Canadian girl who later took her own life.,"photo of Rehtaeh Parsons, 17, of Nova Scotia, showing a boy and two boys holding up their hands in a sign of ""No",In the photograph was a boy and two boys holding their hands in a gesture of ‘No!’ ,", I'm going!

Webb, who has been named on the bench, has not played for Wales since suffering a foot injury in September.
""We all knew that as soon as Webby was fit he was going to be straight back in the squad. I expected it,"" said Davies.
""It is a bit of extra pressure for me but I enjoy it.""
England are one point clear of Wales at the top of the table with three wins from three games.
Webb scored a try in the win over England in Cardiff in the 2015 Six Nations, while Davies scored a crucial late try in their victory in the 2015 World Cup, a competition Webb missed following surgery.
Davies, 25, has scored six tries in 12 Wales appearances while 27-year-old Webb has five in 16 games.
England have a 100% record under new coach Eddie Jones, while Wales beat Scotland and France after drawing their opening game in Ireland.
If England beat Wales they face a trip to France on 19 March chasing a first Grand Slam since 2003.
Victory for Wales on Saturday would leave them needing to beat Italy at home to win the championship for the third time in five years.
Davies said: ""In a couple of the games in this campaign we have started off a bit slowly.

"PwC's annual survey shows that just 37% think the economy will improve in 2015, down from 44% last year.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Russia's bosses have gone from the most confident to the least, due to problems caused by sanctions and the falling oil price.
In the UK, concern had risen sharply about the availability of talent.
The number of chief executives concerned about the skills gap rose from 64% last year to 84% this year. That is considerably higher than in Germany, France or Spain.
This was partly put down to the high level of employment in the UK, which means that there is a smaller pool of workers to choose from, and partly due to concerns about the education system.
On a global level, the biggest worries that chief executives have are geo-political uncertainties, over-regulation and cyber security.
The report, which was launched at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, said that ""concerns about cyber threats have shot up most compared to last year - and in light of the recent attacks on gaming and entertainment networks, the perceived risk will only increase"".
Dennis Nally, chairman of PwC said: ""CEO confidence is down notably in oil-producing nations around the world as a result of plummeting crude oil prices. Russia CEOs, for example, were the most confident in last year's survey, but are the least confident this year.
""Confidence has also slipped among CEOs in the Middle East, Venezuela, and Nigeria,"" he said.
He also pointed out that there appeared to a shift in confidence from emerging market to western markets.
Chief executives ranked the US as their most important market for growth over the next year, putting it ahead of China for the first time in the five years that the question has been asked.
PwC interviewed more than 1,300 chief executives in 77 countries for the survey.

"Six policemen died in a gunfight during an operation to evict the farmers from land they had been occupying.
Eleven protesters were also killed.
The deaths deepened political tensions in Paraguay and were used by congress to oust the left-wing President Fernando Lugo.
Four men received sentences of between 18 and 30 years in jail, while a further seven men and women were given sentences of between four and six years.
The court heard how the clashes occurred near the city of Curuguaty in Canindeyu province in the east of Paraguay when a group of around 250 riot police were sent to clear a group of around 70 subsistence farmers off a property belonging to an agricultural company called Campos Morumbi.
The farmers had occupied the land as part of a demonstration in favour of agrarian reform.
The Paraguayan prosecution service did not investigate the deaths of the farmers who died during the eviction.
Local and international human rights organizations alleged there had been judicial irregularities during the trial.
Five of the accused had gone on hunger strike for more than 30 days.
√¢‚Ç¨‚ÄπLand ownership has long formed the basis for bloody disputes in Paraguay.
According to the 2008 census, 2.6% of landowners hold 85.5% of Paraguay's land while 91.4% of small farmers, with properties smaller than 20 hectare, hold only 6% of the agricultural land.
Campaigners for agrarian reform have focussed on large agricultural conglomerates involved in the export of soy as being the main cause of the unequal land distribution in Paraguay.

Sheeran's comeback follows a ""gap year"" where he removed himself from social media, making space to write his third album, √É¬∑ (Divide).
Fans were clearly hungry for new material, as the star set several streaming records over the course of the week.
Shape Of You's bouncy, uptempo pop was the bigger hit, notching up 13.4 million streams - smashing the record Drake set last summer, when One Dance was streamed 8.9 million in a single week.
Castle On The Hill, built around a chiming, U2-style guitar riff, also beat Drake's tally, with 11.07 million streams.
On Spotify, Sheeran also broke a global streaming record held by One Direction, whose single Drag Me Down racked up 4.76m streams in one day in August 2015.
Shape Of You was streamed 6.13 million times when it was released last Friday, increasing to 7.24 million streams on Monday.

"From Winston Churchill's infamous visit to Belfast in 1912 to a 1963 Viking invasion re-enactment in a County Down fishing town, as well as tales of tourism, industrial heritage and sport, a dazzling mosaic of Ulster life is pieced together in unseen archive footage.
Hundreds of unique films have been released to the public to view online for free after the British Film Institute (BFI) unlocked its archive as part of a major history project, From Britain On Film.
Royal visits and Lord Mayor's shows are documented in the collection, as is the tale of Churchill's appearance in Belfast when he addressed an audience of nationalists in Celtic Park and gave his support to Home Rule.
There are also dozens of travelogues that were used to sell Northern Ireland to tourists in Great Britain and the United States, helping to boost tourism in the years before the Troubles.
And in sport, the 1930 Ulster Tourist Trophy race held at the Ards circuit in County Down is captured on camera. The event attracted thousands of spectators and commanded the attention of the motorsport world.
The real gems, however, are found in the footage of ordinary people doing extraordinary things.
Films of people at work in the spinning mills and constructing the M1 at Stockman's Lane in Belfast shows Northern Ireland's industry at its booming best.
Another film captures the first time Northern Ireland hosted the World Ploughing Championships, and fittingly it is a local man who takes the title.
The colour footage from the 1959 competition in Armoy, County Antrim, shows Lawrence McMillan's crowning moment as he gets his hands on the Golden Plough.
But perhaps most revealing of all is a 1938 recording of the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.
It gives a rare glimpse into the casualty department and operating theatres as they were then, 10 years before the foundation of the National Health Service.
While medicine has advanced considerably in the eight decades since then, some aspects of healthcare in Northern Ireland appear to remain unchanged - the film ends with an appeal from the chairman of the hospital's management board to reduce waiting lists.
Francis Jones, of Northern Ireland Screen, which gathered much of the footage, said the aim of the project was to preserve delicate film that could otherwise be lost.
""There is a pure nostalgia value to film. It's different to reading a textbook or history book,"" he added.
""To actually see the film has that kind of visceral appeal and really strikes a chord with people.""

"North Ronaldsay Primary School's single classroom will be kept on standby from August as Teigan Scott, 12, moves to secondary in Kirkwall.
Orkney's most northerly island only has a population of about 50 people.
Orkney Islands Council said the school would be brought back into use if more families with young children moved to the island.
The building is also used by community groups.
Island residents have blamed poor transport links for the lack of young families.
Teigan told the BBC she was looking forward to moving on to secondary but worried for the future of her former school.
""I am excited to go up to the bigger school,"" she said.
""But I have a tiny little drop of sadness because the school will be closing and the island might fall apart.""
Councillor Kevin Woodbridge said the population on North Ronaldsay had halved since he arrived in 1977.
He said: ""It's very sad but it demonstrates the decline on the island that has led to this.
""When I came here there were 17 people at the school and 127 on the island, now we have 50 to 60 people.
""The quality of life on the island can be improved considerably.""
Billy Muir, chairman of the community council, said the loss of the school's only pupil was ""a very serious blow for the community and no doubt will have a knock-on effect"".
He said: ""We need new housing to be built and to get new families in. You want a number of kids in the school, not just one.
""Higher speed broadband is needed too.
""There's no point painting a good picture, we have to be realistic. Hopefully this highlights our problem.""
A spokesman for the local authority said: ""North Ronaldsay Primary School's single classroom is part of a building housing a range of community facilities.
""The classroom will be kept on standby from August onwards and would be used as a school room again if a family or families with primary-age children move to the island.

"Ninety-three of the retailer's 125 stores will close, with the rest remaining open while buyers are sought.
If administrator KPMG cannot find buyers, the remaining stores will also shut. The chain employed 1,658 people.
The chain was sold to Greybull Capital last year by supermarket Morrisons, which has said it would offer jobs to ex-My Local staff.
It has struggled to compete in the cut-throat grocery sector, which is caught in a fierce price war.
My Local, formally known as Morrisons' M Local, was sold to Greybull for √Ç¬£25m in a deal fronted by retail veteran Mike Greene, who appeared on Channel 4 show The Secret Millionaire.
Earlier this month My Local said that administrators had been put on notice to take over running the business.
Last week Morrisons offered a lifeline to My Local staff, saying it wanted to offer them jobs in its supermarkets if there were store closures.
Mr Greene said: ""The last nine months has been one of the toughest retail trading periods that I have ever experienced and My Local has faced intense competition.
""The management team has been unable to return the business to profitability. For that I am truly sorry.""
Mark Orton, partner at KPMG and joint administrator, said: ""Management have faced tough trading conditions and despite their best efforts to improve performance, My Local was ultimately unable to return to viability.
""Although the majority of stores have now closed, we are in active discussions with a number of interested parties in relation to both the remaining 32 premises that are trading and a small number of those that have closed,"" he said.

"Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland also told MSPs that a fatal accident inquiry would be held into the death.
Mr Bayoh, 31, died in police custody after being detained following an incident in Kirkcaldy on 3 May.
His family welcomed the comments and said they hoped the Lord Advocate would establish ""the truth of what happened"".
Mr Mullholland told MSPs that further work was needed by the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc), particularly into the cause of death, before the investigation was completed.
""Having met the family on two occasions, I know the effect that this tragedy has had on them and they have borne their loss with great dignity,"" he said.
""They are right to demand answers and a thorough, impartial and objective investigation is what they deserve.""
Mr Mulholland said he was confident this could be done ""expeditiously without compromising thoroughness"".
He added that regardless of the decision on criminal proceedings, a fatal accident inquiry would be held because Mr Bayoh had died in custody.
""A fatal accident inquiry will allow all the evidence to be presented in a court, open to the public and the media, to be rigorously tested by all parties represented at the FAI, including the family, and allow the sheriff to make findings in fact and recommendations in relation to Sheku's death in a judgement that will be available to all,"" he said.

"Engineers on the Thameslink Programme uncovered the former ticket hall and platforms of Southwark Park station.
The long-lost station only served passengers from 1902 to 1915 before shutting for good.
The ¬£6.5bn Thameslink Programme is rebuilding railway lines from New Cross Gate through London Bridge to Blackfriars and St Pancras.
Located on a viaduct above Rotherhithe New Road, Southwark Park was one of several stations in the area, including Spa Road, which closed because of competition from trams and buses and the outbreak of World War One.
The station was discovered as engineers constructed the Bermondsey Dive Under, which will see two Victorian viaducts partially-demolished and rebuilt to allow trains from south east London and Kent to dive down, under a new route carrying Thameslink services from Croydon.
Project manager Greg Thornett said: ""We uncovered the footings for the former platforms while we were preparing the top of the viaduct for new track and we are now working up in the roof space of the former ticket hall to fill in the old skylights, ready to carry the final track alignment.

"The study tracked more than 200,000 Australian smokers and non-smokers above the age of 45 over six years.
Mortality risk went up with cigarette use, BMC Medicine reports.
Smoking 10 cigarettes a day doubled the risk, while 20-a-day smokers were four to five times more likely to die.
Although someone who smokes could lead a long life, their habit makes this less likely.
Smoking increases the risk of a multitude of health problems, including heart disease and cancer.
Cancer Research UK currently advises that half of all long-term smokers eventually die from cancer or other smoking-related illnesses.
But recent evidence suggests the figure may be higher.
Newer studies in UK women, British doctors and American Cancer Society volunteers have put the figure at up to 67%, says Prof Emily Banks, lead author of the Australian study.
""We knew smoking was bad, but we now have direct independent evidence that confirms the disturbing findings that have been emerging internationally.
""Even with the very low rates of smoking that we have in Australia, we found that smokers have around threefold the risk of premature death of those who have never smoked. We also found smokers will die an estimated 10 years earlier than non-smokers,"" she said.
George Butterworth, tobacco policy manager at Cancer Research UK, said: ""It's a real concern that the devastation caused by smoking may be even greater than we previously thought.
""Earlier research has shown, as a conservative estimate, one in two long-term smokers die from smoking-related diseases in the UK, but these new Australian figures show a higher risk.
""Smoking habits differ between Australia and the UK [in terms of] how much people smoke and the age they start, so we can't conclude that the two-in-three figure necessarily applies to the UK.""
In Australia, about 13% of adults smoke. In the UK, the figure is about 20%.
Stopping smoking can bring a person's health risks back down.
Ten years after quitting, risk of lung cancer falls to half that of a smoker and risk of heart attack falls to the same as someone who has never smoked, according to NHS Smokefree.","The death risk from smoking may be much higher than previously thought - tobacco kills up to two in every three smokers not one in every two, data from a large study suggests.","a study tracked more than 200,000 Australian smokers and non-smokers above the age of 45 over six years.

"The collection of images, along with medals and badges, will go on auction later in July.
The find ""is like a time capsule that sheds new light on the war"", auctioneer Charles Hanson said.
The photos were taken by Robert Oliver, who survived the 1899-1902 war.
He was awarded the Queens Medal for South Africa after fighting in Cape Colony, the Orange Free State and the Transvaal in 1901 and 1902.
""The graphic images record the harsh reality, and true horror, of war - something the Victorian press did not portray at the time, as the British Empire was deemed undefeatable,"" Mr Hanson said.
The photos include prints of war dead lying in fields, the funeral of a British serviceman and a Boer War dog.
The collection also contains two pairs of original kid gloves, spurs, an ammunition bandolier, caps and hats, an original South African feathered headdress and a cartridge belt.
Mr Hanson said: ""Robert Oliver was quite a rogue in his youth. At the age of 16, he ran away, ending up on a ship to Canada where he found work as a lumberjack.

"Data in its first call home since Tuesday's flyby suggest the spacecraft experienced no upsets as it hurtled past the icy world at 14km/s (31,000mph).
The signal came through a giant dish in Madrid, Spain - part of a Nasa network of communications antennas.
The message took four hours 25 minutes to traverse 4.7 billion km of space.
The tension mounted as scientists and engineers at mission headquarters in Laurel, Maryland, waited for telemetry information. So there was joy and relief when the signal was received at 01:52 BST; team members cheered, hugged each other and waved American flags.
""We are in lock with telemetry from the spacecraft,"" said mission operations manager Alice Bowman as confirmation was received.
""We have a healthy spacecraft, we have recorded data from the Pluto system, and we are outbound from Pluto.""
A few minutes later, she added: ""I can't express how I feel. It's just like we planned it!""
Nasa's administrator Charles Bolden said: ""With this mission, we have visited every single planet in the Solar System.""
The agency's science chief John Grunsfeld commented: ""This is a tremendous moment in human history,"" adding: ""The spacecraft is full of images and we can't wait.""
Operations manager Alice Bowman confirmed that New Horizons' solid state recorder should be full of data.
""The expected number of segments on that recorder had been used. That tells us that that data has been collected on the spacecraft,"" she explained.
The signal received on Wednesday morning contained only engineering data, and was designed to tell controllers whether the flyby sequence had been carried out properly. The first high-resolution pictures from the flyby should be downlinked later on Wednesday.
Ralph Semmel, director of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, where mission control is based, congratulated the mission team.
""What has Pluto given us? Whales, doughnuts, and a heart,"" he said, referring to informal names for surface features in images taken during the spacecraft's approach.
Team members had expressed confidence the flyby would go well, but there was a very small possibility that New Horizons could be lost as it sped through the Pluto system.
Any stray icy debris would have been lethal if it had collided with the spacecraft at its 14km/s velocity .
James Christy, who discovered Pluto's moon Charon, joined relatives of Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered the dwarf planet itself in 1930, at mission control to witness receipt of the signal.

"On Monday, Mrs May met the first and deputy first ministers on a one-day visit to Northern Ireland.
She stressed that no-one wanted a return to the ""borders of the past"".
Her meeting with Mr Kenny is understood to have focused on the impact of Brexit on British and Irish relations.
Earlier in July, shortly after her appointment as the new prime minister, Mrs May spoke to Mr Kenny by telephone and agreed to build on the ""strong relationship""  between the UK and the Republic of Ireland..
Northern Ireland Secretary of State James Brokenshire described Mrs May's meeting with Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness on Monday as ""positive"".
He also said there was agreement about protecting the current border arrangements between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.
""I think that the prime minister had a really helpful exchange with the first minister and the deputy first minister and I think there is a strong will and strong commitment to not see the return to the borders of the past,"" he said.
""Indeed that's a theme that underlined discussions that I previously had with the taoiseach on Friday.""
Mr Brokenshire added that there were ""treaties and various other mechanisms"" in place that underlined that there was a ""different arrangement"" between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.
Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said he hoped there would be an ""arrangement which will see the people of the north of Ireland continuing to see their future in Europe as part of an imaginative solution.""
The DUP MP Gavin Robinson said there were ""two aspects"" that had to be considered relating to the border.
""So far, discussions have focussed on the movement of people, there will also need to be a discussion about the movement of goods, customs and whether or not there is a form of a single market or not, whether there is a disparity in tariffs or not and if that is the case, then how you control that,"" he said.
""So whilst I see no difficulty in getting an arrangement that builds on the Common Travel Area and that allows you and I to move freely into the Republic of Ireland and similarly people from the Republic of Ireland can move freely into the United Kingdom, knowing that we have a uniform immigration policy, it may well be that further discussions will need to take place.""",Prime Minister Theresa May has held talks with Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Enda Kenny at Downing Street.,"between the DUP and Sinn Fein, the parties which have ruled Northern Ireland for decades.

Nicky Barr, director of the centre, said it looked like those responsible had cut a perimeter fence and that the scuff marks inside the memorial were probably caused as the blocks fell.

"Pte Sean Benton was found dead at the Surrey barracks with five gunshot wounds in June 1995, while on guard at a perimeter fence.
Human rights group Liberty said the Attorney General had given his family consent to apply to the High Court.
An earlier inquest recorded a verdict of suicide on the 20-year-old soldier.
The coroner at a second inquest on Pte Cheryl James, who died at Deepcut in 1995 from a single gunshot wound, recorded a verdict of suicide earlier this month. The Cheryl James inquest heard from more than 100 witnesses.
Delivering his verdict, Brian Barker QC launched a scathing attack on welfare standards at Deepcut and said there was overwhelming evidence of a sexualised atmosphere there.
Liberty, on behalf of Pte Benton's twin brother Tony and his sister Tracy Lewis, lodged an application with the Attorney General in July 2015 requesting that the original inquest of July 1995 be quashed and a fresh one ordered.
It said that since his death, many people had stated publicly and to his family that they believed Pte Benton, from Hastings, East Sussex had been the victim of physical and psychological bullying at the barracks.
""We have been overwhelmed and disturbed by all the details of the shameful environment at Deepcut which have finally come to light through the Cheryl James inquest - it is terrible to think of Sean alone there,"" said Ms Lewis.
""More than two decades after our brother died - and having lost both our parents in recent years - Tony and I are determined to find out what happened to Sean.""
Pte Benton was the first of four young recruits to die of gunshot wounds at Deepcut between 1995 and 2002.
Liberty said the initial inquest a month after his death heard evidence from six people. Pte Benton's medical and mental health records were not obtained and no evidence was sought or given concerning his experiences at the barracks.
Liberty lawyer Emma Norton said if Pte Benton's death had been properly and independently investigated in 1995, decades of pain and uncertainty for the family would have been avoided.

"James Percival, 66, said he gave mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to newborn Jonathan Percival in the vicarage in Freckleton, Lancashire, in 2014.
But Ruth Percival, 30, said she had not seen him make any attempts to revive the baby.
The inquest was halted in October when new medical evidence led the coroner to refer the case to prosecutors.
In March, the Crown Prosecution Service said there remained ""insufficient evidence"" to charge anyone.
The hearing at Blackpool Town Hall was told that Miss Percival, who has some special educational needs, visited her GP surgery in August 2014 to arrange to terminate a pregnancy, but had been unable to have one because she was too far gone.
She agreed she had put her ""head in the sand"" about the pregnancy and had not told her parents because she was ""scared"" of their reaction.
Mr Percival, who at the time was the vicar of Holy Trinity CE Church in Freckleton, said after she returned home from work in the afternoon on 25 November she spent time in the downstairs toilet.
He said at about 15:30 GMT he saw her come out of the bathroom carrying a towel covered with what he believed to be excrement and went outside with her to put it in a bin ""when Jonathan's leg came in sight"".
He told the court: ""I said to Ruth, 'this is a baby, you can't put a baby in the bin'.""
He said he placed the baby on the towel on the floor outside and attempted to resuscitate him.
He said the baby ""was very, very cold, absolutely lifeless"", adding: ""The baby was quite clearly dead.""
The inquest heard that medical evidence showed the baby was alive at the time he was born.
Miss Percival said she thought she saw the baby trying to take a breath, but also said: ""I kind of thought I did have a miscarriage because to me the baby was dead when he came out of me.""
Miss Percival and her father gave evidence that Jonathan had the umbilical cord wrapped round his neck.

"The National Environment Research Council defended its decision to hold a public poll to suggest names, in which Boaty McBoatface got the most support.
Professor Duncan Wingham said the row had ""put a smile"" on people's faces.
But MPs asked if he would be made to ""walk the plank"" by ministers, who named it after Sir David Attenborough.
Prof Wingham was giving evidence to the Commons Science and Technology Committee about the episode, which attracted huge public interest and divided opinion after Boaty McBoatface was passed over.
He said that ministers' decision to name the vessel after the eminent zoologist and broadcaster - the option which came fourth in the poll - while allowing Boaty McBoatface to live on by naming a remotely operated sub-sea vehicle after it was an ""eloquent compromise"".
Asked by Conservative MP Nicola Blackwood what the episode had done for public engagement in science, the academic said it had attracted ""extraordinary attention"" which could only be regarded as an ""incredible success"".
""We could make the claim that we are probably the best-known research council in the world,"" he said.
""We could make the claim that because of that there are hundreds of thousands of people, not only in the UK but around the world, who know about us and the science that we have done

"Mencap and the Challenging Behaviour Foundation have spoken of the risks of moving patients hundreds of miles.
The warning comes as the results of a serious case review into the abuse of patients at the private hospital near Bristol are due to be released.
The abuse was uncovered during secret filming by the BBC Panorama programme.
Eleven people have admitted charges of ill-treatment and neglect related to the abuse.
South Gloucestershire Safeguarding Adults Board (SAB) commissioned the review, carried out by an independent expert.
Mencap and the Challenging Behaviour said they had received 260 reports from families concerning abuse and neglect in institutional care since the Panorama programme was aired in May last year.
Their joint report - Out of Sight - detailed a number of serious incidences reported by families, including physical assault, sexual abuse and the overuse of restraint.
Mencap chief executive Mark Goldring said: ""We fear that unless the government commits to a strong action plan to close large institutions and develop appropriate local services for people with a learning disability, there is a very real risk that another Winterbourne View will come to light.""
There are currently hundreds of people with a learning disability in assessment and treatment units like Winterbourne View, the charities said.
Many of these are located hundreds of miles from home, where people are at particular risk of neglect and abuse, they added.
Vivien Cooper, founder of the Challenging Behaviour Foundation, said they had ""deep concerns"" over patient ""safety and welfare"".
""Many hundreds of people with a learning disability are being sent away to care institutions hundreds of miles from home, where they remain for years unnecessarily, at risk of neglect and abuse,"" she said.
A Department of Health spokeswoman said: ""We are clear that wherever possible people should be supported to live in their own homes within their local community.
""In a small number of cases people might need access to good quality assessment and treatment services which might include some short periods of in-patient care.
""However this is not a substitute for high quality care within the community.
""It is vital all services are commissioned properly, reviewed regularly and not used as a long-term solution.""
Twenty-four patients were transferred from Castlebeck-run Winterbourne View, near Hambrook, following the BBC investigation.
The hospital was closed the following month.
The criminal charges related to five patients at the hospital.
All the defendants are awaiting sentence.","Another Winterbourne View care home scandal could happen again unless action is taken by the government, campaigners have warned.","by Professor Peter White, the Chief Medical Officer for England, will look at whether patients with dementia should be more intensively treated.

"The decision was taken despite the 26-year-old running the Olympic qualifying time on six occasions and coming third in the trials.
""I accept I will never win an Olympic medal,"" she wrote on eightlane.org.
UK Athletics said they do not respond to individual selection policy when asked for a response.
Shelayna Oskan-Clarke and Lynsey Sharp were the only 800m runners named in the Team GB squad for Rio, with a third place left unfilled.
""To leave a space empty on an Olympic team when several athletes have the qualifying standard is an insult to the effort that athletes put in to the sport,"" said Leonard.

An Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) statement it could not agree to play against ""a country where terrorists are housed and provided safe havens"".
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) later accused the ACB of ""playing politics"".
Pakistan has rejected an Afghan claim that it was involved the attack in the capital.
A PCB statement added: ""The PCB strongly rejects the baseless allegations levelled by Afghanistan Cricket Board in the wake of the tragic Kabul blast.
""While our sympathies are with the victims and families affected by the tragedy, we reject the irresponsible statement made by the ACB and hereby announce the cancellation of the proposed series between the two countries.
""The informal understanding with ACB last weekend was strictly subject to conducive security conditions in Afghanistan and now stands cancelled because of continuing insecurity and instability there.""
The bomb killed at least 90 people in Kabul, where a Twenty20 match between the two countries was provisionally scheduled to take place later this year.
That match would have been followed by a fixture in Pakistan and a full series at an undetermined date.

"The company has ""paused"" production at its Redcar blast furnace blaming a slump in demand and rising costs.
SSI took over the former Tata Steel complex after it was mothballed in 2010 and employs almost 2,000 people.
Ms Soubry said EU rules meant state cash could not be directly used to support British steel production.
SSI chief operating officer Cornelius Louwrens called on the government to ""take action rather than use just words"" to help ensure the plant survives.
He said: ""Other European countries are finding ways to support their steel industries because they believe it is so important.""
He urged ministers to approve the underwriting of ""key projects"" to enable it to secure commercial loans, as well as reduce business rates and ease restrictions linked to CO2 emissions.
But, Ms Soubry said: ""There are extremely strict state aid rules, which especially apply to the steel industry, so we are limited as to what we can do.
""We can put money into things like research and development. But simply giving a loan or underwriting things, we cannot do.
""Things are extremely difficult at SSI, but our hands are tied. However, we will continue to work with the company and the trade unions, but the underlying problem in all of this is that there is an overproduction of steel across the world.

"Campaign group Liberty says the powers, which are used by intelligence agencies to collect large volumes of data from electronic devices, amount to an ""assault on our freedom"".
The Investigatory Powers Act gained royal assent in November.
The government has said it will defend the act.
Powers covered by the act allow state agencies to control and alter electronic devices, read texts, online messages and emails and listen in on calls, regardless of a suspicion of criminal activity.
The act forces communications companies to retain data of the who, where and when, but not the content of people's phone calls, emails, texts and web browsing history.
But Liberty wants to challenge the lawfulness of these powers and is asking the public to fund a judicial review.
Liberty director Martha Spurrier said: ""Last year, this government exploited fear and distraction to quietly create the most extreme surveillance regime of any democracy in history.
""Hundreds of thousands of people have since called for this act's repeal because they see it for what it is - an unprecedented, unjustified assault on our freedom.""
In November 2016, a petition asking the government to repeal the act attracted more than 118,000 signatures.
Investigatory Powers Act
The act was first proposed by Prime Minister Theresa May when she was home secretary and was approved by the House of Lords on 19 November.
Bulk powers are among the most controversial in the legislation, but security services and the government argue that they play a crucial role in counter-terrorism efforts.
Last month, the government faced calls to amend the act after the European Court of Justice found the ""general and indiscriminate"" retention of communications data was illegal.
EU judges said communications data could only be retained if it was used to fight serious crime.
The BBC's legal correspondent Clive Coleman said the government has said it will vigorously defend the act, which it says protects both privacy and security, had faced unprecedented parliamentary scrutiny and enjoyed cross parliamentary support.","A human rights group is launching a crowd-funded legal challenge to the UK government's so-called ""snoopers' charter"".","proposals by the Home Affairs Select Committee will not involve any new powers for the police to read the content of emails and other messages.

"Thomas Groome, 53, was last seen by his family in Thorne in Doncaster on New Year's Day, 2010.
Jason Thaxter, of Hexthorpe, Doncaster, was convicted of murder and conspiracy to prevent a burial following a five-week trial.
He was jailed at Sheffield Crown Court and ordered to serve a minimum of 30 years in prison.

Mr Groome's disappearance was initially treated as a missing person's inquiry but a murder investigation was launched in 2012.
Thaxter, 39, and his mother, June Buttle, were first arrested in 2013.
Buttle was charged the following year but there was insufficient evidence to charge her son at the time.
The 57-year-old, of Doncaster, was jailed in 2015 for 16 years after pleading guilty to manslaughter, conspiracy to prevent a burial and fraud.
Temp Det Ch Supt Lisa Ray, of South Yorkshire Police, said she hoped the pair would do the ""decent thing"" by telling Mr Groome's family where his body was.
In a statement, his relatives described him as a ""larger-than-life character"", who loved to travel.
It added: ""On the 1st January 2010 we said goodbye to him not knowing that this was the last time that we would see and speak to him.

"Profits at the technology giant were up 17% from the same period last year.
""Our devices and services transformation is progressing,"" said boss Steve Ballmer in a statement. He added that Microsoft is launching a ""wide range"" of new products in the coming quarter.
The report shed no light on who is to replace Mr Ballmer, who announced plans to retire within the next year.
The company has released several new products this quarter, including an update to Windows 8, and recently bought the mobile phone unit of struggling Finnish giant Nokia.
Shares rose 6% in after hours trading on the strong results.
For the first time, Microsoft also announced sales of its tablet computer, Surface.
It said revenues from Surface ""grew to $400 million with sequential growth in revenue and units sold over the prior quarter"".
Last quarter, the company was forced to take an embarrassing write down of $900m after sluggish sales.
The computer, well-liked by reviewers, marked Microsoft's first foray into hardware manufacturing.
However consumers, many of whom expressed displeasure at Microsoft's update to its popular operating system Windows, did not bite.
The company still did not provide sales figures of the device.
Investors hoping for any information about who will replace Mr Ballmer in the new year were disappointed.
Earlier today, on a conference call to discuss earnings, Ford boss Alan Mullaly declined to comment on rumours that he was being considered for the top job.
Other contenders include Stephen Elop, the former head of Nokia, who resigned as boss after Microsoft announced it would purchase the Nokia's mobile phone unit for 5.4bn euros ($7.2bn; ¬£4.6bn) in September.
Mr Elop is now head of Devices and Services at Nokia, although he is expected to transfer to Microsoft - where he was once a top manager - once the deal is completed.

"The talks come after Papua New Guinea's Supreme Court ruled the facility unconstitutional, overturning a deal reached between the governments.
Australia sends asylum seekers there under its offshore processing policy.
Papua New Guinea has now said it will close the facility, but it is not clear when that could happen.
Manus Island was first opened in 2001, and along with Australia's other offshore processing centres, has played a central role in Australia's controversial asylum policy.
Papua New Guinea's high commissioner to Australia Charles Lepani said the detainees were now Australia's responsibility, but Australia has remained opposed to taking any of them.
Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said on Thursday there was room for them at another detention centre on Nauru.
""There's capacity [on Nauru] but we're talking with the PNG government about what options are available in PNG and we'll continue those discussions with them,"" Mr Dutton said on Sky News.
This comes after an Iranian asylum seeker held at the Australian-funded detention centre on Nauru set himself on fire on Wednesday.
His actions were a ""political protest"" according to the Nauruan government.
Mr Dutton said the 23-year old man was in a serious condition and was evacuated to Australia for treatment.
Nauru is a small Pacific Island nation about 3,000 km (1,800 miles) north-east of Australia.
It was previously administered by Australia but gained independence in 1968.

Mr Dutton said that the man set himself on fire at a settlement outside the detention centre.
""He's in a very serious condition,"" Mr Dutton said.
""His outlook is not good at all.""
He also confirmed that other asylum seekers held on the island had harmed themselves.
""What we've been very clear about is that if people come to Australia for medical assistance they'll be returning back to Nauru once that medical assistance has been provided.
""We have returned three people back to Nauru from Australia and they have returned because the medical assistance that they sought in Australia has been provided,"" Mr Dutton said.
Representatives from the refugee agency UNHCR were visiting Nauru when the incident occurred, he said.

"The fine print of the deal suggests something slightly different, and shows that GM has in fact taken a hit of up to ¬£6bn in order to get shot of Vauxhall and Opel.
First, a big chunk of the price - three-quarters of a billion pounds - is not for car plants, but for loans taken out by the owners of Opel and Vauxhall cars through GM's finance arm. Peugeot is paying four-fifths of the book value of the outstanding loans.
Second, GM is keeping most of the outstanding pension liabilities. Peugeot will take on a few of the schemes, and is being paid ¬£2.6bn by GM for agreeing to do so.
Third, the Detroit giant will take an accounting hit of ¬£3.2bn on the deal - a confirmation that the value it had placed on Opel and Vauxhall in its own books was born more out of hope and the scale of past investments than any solid expectation of future profits.
GM's financial agony does not mean, of course, that Vauxhall and Opel will not prosper under their new owner.  Peugeot thinks it can squeeze ¬£1.5bn of savings out of the combined operation, and if it can help the French carmaker break into new markets the deal will have done its job.
GM, meanwhile, continues to shrink its ambitions and focus on the future. Since it was bailed out by the US government in the aftermath of the financial crisis, it has closed in America the Oldsmobile, Saturn, Hummer and Pontiac brands, and ditched its plants in Australia, where it had made cars since 1931.

He has previously claimed the campaign was torn by internal feuding.
He was reported to have been on the verge of quitting in February when Labour MP Kate Hoey joined a rival out campaign.
In his resignation letter, the home shopping magnate said he had ""come to believe that it would be useful and more effective for the Leave campaign if there was a strong and independent Labour voice for the arguments to leave the EU"".
""I can now focus fully on my role as ... director of Labour Leave, and create that distinctive voice,"" he said.
""In the run up to the vote on 23 June, Labour Leave will provide a compelling and robust left-of-centre case for leaving the EU.""
The vast majority of Labour MPs are in favour of Britain remaining in the EU - with about a dozen campaigning for an exit.
Labour former minister Frank Field has warned the party it risks losing ""a swathe"" of voters to UKIP by campaigning to remain in the EU.
Mr Mills, who played a leading role in the 1975 referendum campaign against EU membership, has also been critical of Jeremy Corbyn's decision to back staying in.
He said: ""I hope this decision will be a transformative first step to motivating Labour people who are still unsure how they will vote, to vote Leave in June to secure a better, fairer future for this country.

He broke down and confessed to the murder 10 days later he went to tarot reader Jayne Braiden on Brighton seafront.
She alerted police but was told it was a ""non-emergency"" so she waited an hour with the killer for an officer to come.
Ms Braiden told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""By the time we got to the devil card he broke down and started crying.
""It's the first time I've dealt with murder before. It was a shock but you have to be professional and I needed to keep him calm.""
Mr Marney died from a six-inch (15cm) stab wound to his side, which punctured his vital organs.
Sussex Police said it was ""not clear"" what motivated Randel-Hanson - who was jailed for life on 9 May - to carry out the murder.
After gaining the defendant's trust, Ms Braiden asked him whether she could go outside to call the police. He agreed.
She said: ""I explained [to the 999 operator] I was a tarot reader and told her a man had confessed to murder.
""She told me it was a non-priority call and I needed to ring the non-emergency number.
""Unfortunately they didn't believe me, but I'm not surprised at that.""
She said she then bought Randel-Hanson a drink from a shop next door and waited 55 minutes for police to arrive.
""I asked him if it was ok if I took notes... I took names, places, where he had been stabbed and where the body was,"" she said.
""I didn't ask him why, and to be fair I don't think he wanted to talk to me about that.

"Andreea Cristea is the fifth victim of the attack on 22 March, in which Khalid Masood drove into crowds on Westminster Bridge then stabbed a policeman to death, before being shot dead himself.
Ms Cristea, 31, who was on holiday with boyfriend Andrei Burnaz, had been in hospital since the attack.
It has emerged that Mr Burnaz had been planning to propose during the day out.
A family statement confirmed Ms Cristea, who was an architect, had died on Thursday.
The family said: ""After fighting for her life for over two weeks, our beloved and irreplaceable Andreea - wonderful daughter, sister, partner, dedicated friend and the most unique and life loving person you can imagine - was cruelly and brutally ripped away from our lives in the most heartless and spiritless way.
""She will always be remembered as our shining ray of light that will forever keep on shining in our hearts.""
The family said they were ""deeply touched and eternally grateful"" to the ""never-ending dedication"" of the medical staff who treated Ms Cristea, saying their ""kindness and empathy are beyond compare"".
""There are no words to even begin to describe the crushing pain and emptiness that is left in our hearts,"" they continued.
Mr Burnaz, who sustained a broken foot in the attack, visited Westminster Bridge last week to lay a single white rose.
The couple were in London to celebrate Mr Burnaz's birthday and he had been planning to propose to Ms Cristea that day, Romania's UK ambassador Dan Mihalache told the BBC.
He said it was thought Masood's car had mounted the pavement and hit Mr Burnaz, before pushing Ms Cristea into the Thames.
Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he was ""deeply saddened to hear of the death of Andreea Cristea"".
He tweeted: ""Londoners hold her & her loved ones in our thoughts today.""
The other people killed on the bridge were Aysha Frade, 44, who worked at a London sixth-form college, US tourist Kurt Cochran, 54, from Utah, and retired window cleaner Leslie Rhodes, 75, from south London.
Father-of-two PC Keith Palmer was fatally stabbed outside Parliament.
Relatives of those killed joined members of the Royal Family at a ""service of hope"" held at Westminster Abbey on Wednesday.
Ms Cristea's family said they would now like money donated for her recovery to be given to charity.","A Romanian woman who fell into the Thames during the Westminster terror attack has died, police have said.","Andreea Cristea is the fifth victim of the attack on 22 March, in which Khalid Masood drove into crowds on Westminster Bridge and","On the 23rd of March, he ran over and was shot at by Khalid Masood, he was killed by the crowd on the","On the 23rd of March, he was running away, when the enemy shot at him.","He was in a hurry, but he got the order to run. ","Suddenly, he received the order to run off.

"Britain's world heavyweight champion apologised last month for a video he posted online containing homophobic, sexist and anti-Semitic comments.
But ex-champion Klitschko, who fights Fury in Manchester on 9 July, said: ""I was in shock at his statements.
""When he got to the Jewish people he sounded like Hitler. The man is an imbecile.""
The 40-year-old Ukrainian, who lost to Fury in November to suffer his first defeat in 11 years, added: ""We cannot have a champion like that. Either he needs to be shut up or shut down in the ring, or just suspended, because you cannot create more hate.
""I'm fighting a guy who can't hold his mouth on certain things.""
The Campaign Against Antisemitism has also called for Fury to be banned and complained to the British Boxing Board of Control.
The undefeated 27-year-old, who took the WBA and WBO heavyweight titles from Klitschko in their first bout, later said he was sorry for causing offence and promised to improve his behaviour ""as an ambassador of British boxing"".
He was also criticised shortly after his victory over Klitschko last year, when comments on homosexuality, paedophilia and women saw more than 100,000 people sign an online petition seeking to have him removed from the BBC's 2015 Sports Personality of the Year shortlist.","Tyson Fury should be banned from boxing for comments which made him sound ""like Hitler"", Wladimir Klitschko says.",a c***.

"The visitors closed on 293-9 at the end of day three, with a lead of 260.
Jacques Rudolph's wait for a first Championship hundred in 2016 continued as he chopped onto his stumps for 56.
Earlier, Essex had been bowled out for 319, with Craig Meschede (5-84) taking his first five-wicket haul in the Championship this season.
The home side secured promotion and the second-tier title by passing 250 in their first innings, thanks largely to a century from captain Ryan ten Doeschate, who added eight to his overnight score before falling for 117.
With the ball, Ten Doeschate (2-20) removed both Rudolph and Bragg (54) in his first over, the latter having passed 1,000 Championship runs for the season, after the pair had shared a second-wicket stand of 89.
Glamorgan lost six wickets for 36 runs but Mark Wallace (75 not out) and Timm van der Gugten (32) helped push their advantage above 250.
Glamorgan batsman Will Bragg told BBC Wales Sport:
""The four-day game can ebb and flow, but Wally (Mark Wallace) showed some great resilience and put us in a competitive position going into the last day.
""I find it's hard to be consistent in a long season so it's pleasing from that point of view (to reach 1,000), I find more consistency batting at three.

"Logan Murdoch suffered serious injuries in the crash and was not breathing when the Great North Air Ambulance team arrived.
Hayley Murdoch, 29, and Sheila Dixon, 71, both from Carlisle, died following the collision at Newby Cross in 2016.
Dr Laura Duffy called Logan, who made a full recovery, a ""ray of sunshine"".
Logan suffered an ""internal decapitation"", which is a separation of the spinal column from the base of the skull, as well as brain injuries, a punctured lung and a broken collar bone.
Dr Duffy said with the injuries he sustained, he was ""unlikely to survive"".
The young boy was resuscitated at the roadside before being put into a medically-induced coma at the scene.
He was also given blood en route to hospital and went on to make a full recovery.
John Murdoch, Logan's father, said: ""The doctor said that Logan was a very rare case.

"Stefan Appleton, 18, was with friends when he was attacked in Nightingale Park in Islington on 10 June last year.
The killer stabbed him with the 25in (63cm) serrated blade after leaping off a stolen moped, the Old Bailey heard.
The 17-year-old, who cannot be named due to his age, was cleared of murder. He will be sentenced on 21 April.
Mr Appleton, a college student from Islington, had been with friends when his attacker jumped off the back of a scooter, pulled out the weapon and chased after the victim and his friends, the jury heard.
He was stabbed repeatedly after tripping and falling. The cause of his death was shock and haemorrhage due to a stab wound to the chest, police said.
The Metropolitan Police has issued guidance about 'zombie' knives, advising that this is how certain ornate knives are currently being marketed. The force says:
Children were playing in the park at the time of the attack.
As the killer was ridden from the scene, the court heard he shouted out ""RP"" - standing for Red Pitch, a rival to a gang in the Nightingale Park area.
The alleged getaway rider, 17, was cleared of murder while another boy, also 17, was found not guilty of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm.
After the machete attack, the killer fled to Bristol and tried to fly to Malaga in Spain, but was arrested when he returned to London to lie low.
In his defence, the killer said he had come under attack when he went to snatch back his bicycle which had been stolen by another boy.
The court heard he had a previous conviction for possessing a blade after being caught with a lock-knife in a McDonald's restaurant a year before the killing.
Prosecutor Simon Denison QC said Mr Appleton's death was another ""tragic waste of a young life"" taken by a knife.
Speaking after the conviction, Det Ch Insp Chris Jones said: ""There can be absolutely no excuse for young people to carry such dreadful weapons on London's streets and this case once again highlights the awful consequences of doing so.""","A boy has been found guilty of the manslaughter of a teenager he stabbed with a ""Zombie Killer"" machete in north London.",walking towards the scene.

"Lachlan returns to the Murdoch empire as co-chairman of News Corp and 21st Century Fox, having previously stood back to focus on his own businesses.
Meanwhile, younger son James was appointed co-chief operating officer at 21st Century Fox.
After the phone hacking scandal, James quit as executive chairman of News International in 2012.
News Corp is one of the world's biggest media organisations, and owns newspaper titles The Times, Sun, and the Wall Street Journal.

The mayor added he was in close contact with Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick and the force had assured him they have all the resources they need.
The decision to replace police officers with soldiers at key public locations was taken at a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee on Tuesday.
After the announcement the national security threat level was raised to critical and the Palace of Westminster shut to the public.
All tours and events due to take place there have been cancelled with immediate effect.
A man with a knife was arrested outside Buckingham Palace earlier, shortly before the Queen was driven along the Mall. The Met has said the incident is not terror-related.

Other measures being taken include an increase in armed officers to provide support for uniformed and undercover officers trying to spot people carrying out ""hostile reconnaissance"" and other criminal activity in London.
The tactic is ""based on extensive research into the psychology of criminals and what undermines their activities"", the force said.
There will also be an increase in the use of stop and search, vehicle check points and number plate recognition technology.

"In 2014, Kim Lennon said the smuggling of drugs was rife at Lewes Prison and its wings ""resembled a war zone"".
She was dismissed earlier this week following disciplinary proceedings but said she would appeal and had no regrets about speaking out.
The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said Ms Lennon was not dismissed for being a whistleblower.
'Insufficient staff'
Ms Lennon alleged in August 2014 that the drug Spice was being smuggled into the jail.
She said officers were supposed to carry out daily cell checks but there were insufficient staff to do so, and that she feared an inmate or prison officer would be seriously injured.
The Prison Service denied at the time that staffing levels were unsafe and said there was a ""zero-tolerance approach"" to illicit substances.
Ms Lennon was suspended from her job after talking to the The Argus newspaper and the BBC.
""Speaking out has caused me a lot of distress but I don't regret it,"" she said. ""Frontline prison officers are too afraid to speak out because of what will happen to them.""
""I loved my job and I feel like I am being punished for doing the right thing,"" she said.
""I am going to appeal but I'm taking it one day at a time.""
The MoJ said it could not comment because Ms Lennon's dismissal was a confidential matter.
""We would not wish to prejudice a possible appeal,"" it said in a statement, adding it took the issue of staff discipline extremely seriously.

"That is according to new figures from Northern Ireland Screen, which has provided production funding for the HBO series.
The programme, some of which is filmed in Northern Ireland, has been nominated for 24 Emmy awards.
Two of those nominations are for Northern Ireland production crew members.
Ronan Hill, who won an Emmy in 2012, has been nominated again for outstanding sound mixing for a drama, while Carla Stronge has been nominated for outstanding casting for a drama.
Northern Ireland Screen has invested ¬£12.45m in the series since it began in 2010.
For that investment, it is estimated that ¬£110.7m has been spent on goods and services in the Northern Ireland economy.
From 2010-14, Game of Thrones brought in between ¬£21m and ¬£23m a year to Northern Ireland. Those figures have been audited.
In 2014-15, in which series five of Game of Thrones was filmed, NI Screen invested ¬£1.6m in the programme, and the return that created is estimated at ¬£22m.
Game of Thrones is filmed at the Titanic Studios in Belfast, and many other locations across Northern Ireland.
Many local companies are involved in providing services when the series is in production, and sites from the show have become tourist attractions.
Damian Carr, from Game of Thrones Tours, said fans come from all over the world to visit the filming locations.
""We've had people from North and South America, all over Asia - China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan - and all across Europe.
""We started off running one tour a week; now we're running five.""
Richard Williams, chief executive of NI Screen, said Game of Thrones had established Northern Ireland as a world-class location for film and TV production.
""Additionally, films and television programmes have a significant, positive effect on tourism; they contribute to a wider 'branding' of people, society and culture, all of which has a very strong influence on creating a desire to travel.

"The suspects are accused of smuggling large quantities of cocaine from Colombia to Europe in sailing boats.
Officials said among those arrested is a commander of the Colombian left-wing rebel group, Farc.
Police said the suspects were part of a transatlantic drugs ring run by the 'Ndrangheta crime syndicate, which has its base in southern Italy.
The investigation, dubbed Santa Fe, was carried out jointly by Italian agents, members of the US Drug Enforcement Administration and Spain's Guardia Civil.
Officials said the drug ring operated in countries as far flung as Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Spain and Montenegro.
The identity of the Farc commander has not yet been made public, but Colombian media said it would soon be revealed.
The rebel group derives much of its finances from cocaine production and trafficking.
Officials said that in the course of their investigations they seized a total of four tonnes of cocaine.
One of the largest seizures was in the night of 25-26 August last year when the Spanish navy stopped a sailboat heading for the Italian coast.
They found 856kg of cocaine on board.
They said that the drugs were smuggled from Colombia mainly into southern Italian port of Gioia Tauro in Calabria, but that they were also taken to ports in northern Italy such as Vado Ligure, Livorno and Genoa.

"A report has said uniting council departments with different responsibilities would help improve the town's prospects.
The strategy aims to reduce the number of empty shop units, increase visitors with more public events and reduce antisocial behaviour.
It is being discussed at a council meeting on Wednesday afternoon.
Town centre forum business group chairman Andrew Atkinson welcomed the report and said it could lead to be a ""huge turnaround for Wrexham"".
The report highlights how one department looks after town centre economic strategy while others deal with cleaning up the streets or looking after licensing and public protection issues although they share a common goal.
It recommends a single group taking forward all issues that tackle town centre improvements.
Mr Atkinson said: ""It has got to be action and not words from the council.""
He said the authority was taking positive steps with shops' vacancy rates reducing due to more independent shops opening, but he admitted bigger units formerly occupied by multi national firms were ""harder to fill"".

"The 24-year-old, who cannot be named until he enters his plea, is accused of raping the teenager in the toilets of a bar in Johannesburg.
Earlier in the week, the family of the alleged victim said that Mr Mandela's ex-wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, had sent her bodyguard to dissuade them from pressing charges.
The Mandela family has not commented.
Senior members of the Mandela family, including the former president's daughter Makaziwe Mandela, were in court during a brief hearing.
His bail application has been postponed until Tuesday, meaning he cannot legally be named until then.
He has been in custody since his arrest on Saturday.
The BBC understands that he will argue that it was consensual sex and he didn't know that his accuser was underage since the pub did not allow under-21s on its premises.
Under South African law, sex with someone under 16 is classed as rape whether consensual or not.
BBC Southern Africa correspondent Karen Allen says the family of South Africa's first black president have found themselves constantly in the public spotlight.

"Members of Braintree's Dolphin Women's Institute (WI) have stitched some of the town's best-known landmarks including the church and museum.
Each model is about 45cm (18in) tall and was created using a polystyrene or cardboard core with knitting sewn on.
It took nine knitters seven months to complete the seven miniature buildings which will be displayed at the town's museum next month.
The group's vice-president, Elaine Pye, said the project was inspired by a similar one a relative had been involved in knitting in Hertfordshire.
""They knitted their own cottages, but we couldn't really do that so chose some of the town's beautiful iconic buildings,"" she said.
Mrs Pye put together the polystyrene structures and each knitter got to work, returning after two weeks with their latest knitted piece of church spire or pub frontage.
After much gluing, sewing and additional knitted embellishments, the town finally took shape, brought together with mini woollen market stalls.
The group created models of the town hall, church, Swan pub, library, museum, shopping centre and even the railway station complete with knitted train.

"A total of 374 employees lost their jobs when Tullis Russell Papermakers, based at Markinch in Fife, went into administration in April 2015.
Each employee received the equivalent of eight weeks' wages in compensation for their loss.
The award follows a judgement from an employment tribunal in Dundee.
Lawyers said that despite the company directors being under an obligation to provide employees with at least 45 days' notice - as more than 100 workers were losing their jobs - this was ignored, meaning each employee was entitled to sue for compensation.
However, acting alone would have meant each affected worker lodging ""an extremely complex"" and expensive employment tribunal claim, so they made a joint bid.
David Martyn, a senior employment lawyer at Thompsons, the firm that represented the workers, said: ""The more notice the workforce have to prepare for these devastating changes, the better they can organise their financial responsibilities to soften the blow.
""This award of compensation will be paid by UK administration service.
""That means that the taxpayer has picked up the tab because company directors have played fast and loose with the rules.

"Kathryn Smith said she received ¬£52 a week in income support, some of which was used to buy the Class B substance.
Jurors previously heard she was concerned 21-month-old Ayeeshia Jane Smith may have had a seizure after taking drugs kept at the house.
Ms Smith and ex-partner Matthew Rigby both deny murder.
More on this and other stories from Stoke and Staffordshire
The toddler, known as AJ, died in 2014 at the couple's flat in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire.
Under questioning from prosecutors, Ms Smith, 23, said she did not initially tell doctors treating Ayeeshia over her fears she had accessed drugs because she feared they would think she was ""a bad mother"".
She also said she did not tell police about the drugs being at home because she knew they were illegal.
A quantity of cannabis worth ¬£30 was found inside a Tommee Tippee plastic cup at the property on Britannia Drive after Ayeeshia's death but Ms Smith said her daughter did not use the cup as it was broken.
The court heard a senior social worker had reported seeing Ms Smith, of Sandfield Road, Nottingham, looking ""spaced out"" during a home visit a week prior to Ayeeshia's collapse, although her daughter had not been in the house at the time.
Two social workers had tried to conduct an on-the-spot drugs search at the flat on 17 April 2014, days before Ayeeshia died, after smelling cannabis, but Ms Smith refused to comply.
Text messages made by Ms Smith to Mr Rigby and her parents were mentioned by the prosecution, including one where she threatened her father on the day Ayeeshia died.
Christopher Hotten QC, prosecuting, said the message showed her in a bad temper ""on the day somebody killed your daughter in anger"".
However, Ms Smith said:  ""Nobody was angry on that day, or the day before that, nobody was being angry that day.""
Jurors at Birmingham Crown Court previously heard her death was caused when her heart was torn by a forceful stamp.

"Hank Costain, 88, from Charminster, near Dorchester, first flew a Spitfire in 1942, at the age of 19.
The maiden flight of the Supermarine Spitfire took place on 5 March 1936, from Eastleigh Aerodrome, now Southampton Airport.
Mr Costain described flying a Spitfire as ""absolutely marvellous"".
He said: ""When you first got into the seat and opened the throttle it felt as if someone had given you a good kick up the bottom and away you went.
""It would do everything you asked of it. Compared to other aircraft it was light on the controls, you could do all the aerobatics and you would come up to speed very quickly.
""If you treated a Spitfire properly, it treated you properly. Treat it roughly or be careless with it and you were in trouble, in that it would do all sorts of things such as ground looping. It also had a very fragile undercarriage and could collapse.""
Mr Costain was a member of the RAF for 37 years.
He flew operational Spitfires over Europe, north Africa, the Middle East and Burma.
He was also a Spitfire instructor during that time and became a test pilot on Spitfires at 9MU Cosford, Shropshire.
He said: ""Everyone that joined the air force wanted to fly a Spitfire.
""I would say that I have flown nearly all of the operational Spitfires.
""There aren't many of us left [alive] that have flown the number of different marks of Spitfire that I have.""
During and since his flying days, Mr Costain says he has often been asked if he was frightened during the war years.
He said: ""I was terrified, but I was terrified of letting my own friends see that I was frightened. One made one's self very determined that you wouldn't show that.
""If you were attacked when you were flying a Spitfire during the war years, you turned hard into the attacking aircraft and they just couldn't get behind you! It was much more manoeuvrable than the German aircraft.
""I don't think we should ever forget what the Spitfire did for England. It was virtually England's saving grace.""","A former RAF Spitfire pilot from Dorset has been remembering the ""beautiful aircraft"" in the week it celebrates its 75th anniversary.","88-year-old Hank Costain, who flew a Spitfire in 1942, was hit by a bomb on the night of August 16","In the year of 1943, Hank Costain, who flew a Spitfire, was killed by a bomb.","“In 1943, Hank Costain, the sabre-flying wing-bearer, was killed by a bomb.","' In 1943, the sabre-flying wing-bearer Hank Costain was killed by a bomb.","A sabre-flying, flying wing-bearer Hank Costain was killed in 1943.","And a sabre-flying, flying-winged wing-bearer, Hank Costain, was killed in 1943.","""The Spitfire is a wonderful aircraft and the whole world is now aware of what it is like to fly it,"" said Hank Costain, 88","“The Spitfire is a marvelous aircraft, and the whole world now knows what it’s like to fly it,” said Hank Costain, who was ",“The Spitfire is a marvelous plane and it’s now known to the world that it’s flying. ,""" The Spitfire is a marvelous aircraft, and it's known that it is flying. ","The Spitfire is a fine aircraft, and it is known that it is flying. ","It is a fine aircraft, and it is known that it is flying. "
"As many as 23 civilians were killed in the raid on a village in Yakla district on Saturday, including 10 children, rights group Reprieve says.
Yemeni reports say the victims included the daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, a militant killed by a US strike in 2011.
The raid was the first such operation authorised by President Donald Trump.
The US military had previously said a Navy Seal, William ""Ryan"" Owens, 36, died and three others were injured. But the US Central Command (Centcom) later said that those killed could include children.
Several Apache helicopters were reported to have taken part in the operation, which killed 14 militants, including three al-Qaeda leaders, according to the US military.
White House spokesman Sean Spicer told journalists: ""It's hard to ever call something a complete success when you have a loss of life or people injured.""
""But I think when you look at the totality of what was gained to prevent the future loss of life... I think it's a successful operation in all standards.""
He made no mention of civilian victims.
Earlier on Thursday, Reprieve said a newborn baby was among 10 children killed in the attack.
It also cited local reports as saying that a heavily pregnant woman was shot in the stomach during the raid and subsequently gave birth to an injured baby boy who later died.
Images of several dead children emerged on social media soon after the attack took place.
Earlier this week, Pentagon spokesman Capt Jeff Davis told reporters to ""take reports of female casualties with a grain of salt"", adding that they had been ""trained to be ready and trained to be combatants"".
But US military Central Command on Wednesday acknowledged that a number of civilians had been ""likely killed in the midst of a firefight"".
Mr Trump travelled to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Thursday to receive the body of the US Navy Seal, William 'Ryan' Owens, who was killed in the raid.

"It is understood the Hammers will raise their offer for the player who began his career at the east London club.
Defoe, 34, has scored 11 goals in 21 appearances for the Premier League strugglers this season.
His latest goals came on Monday as Sunderland twice fought from a goal down to draw 2-2 with in-form Liverpool, which left manager David Moyes's side in 18th position.
Defoe's senior career began at West Ham before he moved to rivals Tottenham in a ¬£7m deal in 2004, with striker Bobby Zamora going the other way. A ¬£7.5m move to Portsmouth followed in January 2008 before he returned to Spurs the following year for ¬£15m.
Defoe made a surprise move to Canadian team Toronto FC in 2014 before he was  lured to Sunderland in 2015 by former Black Cats boss and ex-Spurs team-mate Gus Poyet.

West Ham will return to test the resolve of Sunderland, but it's unthinkable the Black Cats can afford to sell Defoe given their precarious position.

"Writing in the Journal of Aesthetic Nursing, clinicians say there is a growing trend for under-25s to seek the wrinkle-smoothing injections.
But the research suggests ""frozen faces"" could stop young people from learning how to express emotions fully.
A leading body of UK plastic surgeons says injecting teenagers for cosmetic reasons is ""morally wrong"".
Botox and other versions of the toxin work by temporarily paralysing muscles in the upper face to reduce wrinkling when people frown.
Nurse practitioner Helen Collier, who carried out the research, says reality TV shows and celebrity culture are driving young people to idealise the  ""inexpressive frozen face.""
But she points to a well-known psychological theory, the facial feedback hypothesis, that suggests adolescents learn how best to relate to people by mimicking their facial expressions.
She says: ""As a human being our ability to demonstrate a wide range of emotions is very dependent on facial expressions.
""Emotions such as empathy and sympathy help us to survive and grow into confident and communicative adults.""
But she warns that a ""growing generation of blank-faced"" young people could be harming their ability to correctly convey their feelings.
""If you wipe those expressions out, this might stunt their emotional and social development,"" she says.
The research calls for practitioners to use assessment tools to decide whether there are clear clinical reasons for Botox treatment.
Several assessment scales exist that take into account how thick the skin is, how sun-damaged it appears, and the depth of any wrinkles, but experts warn that some Botox clinics are putting financial gain first.
Ms Collier calls on therapists to spend time helping young people boost their confidence rather than reaching for injections.
She adds: ""Though most of the effects of the toxin are temporary, research suggests the muscles don't fully recover from injections.
""We really need to understand the consequences of starting treatments too soon.""
Dr Michael Lewis, a researcher in psychology at Cardiff University, says: ""The expressions we make on our face affect the emotions we feel.
""We smile because we are happy, but smiling also makes us happy.
""Treatment with drugs like Botox prevents the patient from being able to make a particular expression and can therefore have an effect on our learning to feel emotions naturally.""
Rajiv Grover, president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, says: ""Injecting teenagers with Botox for cosmetic purposes is morally wrong and something that no ethical practitioner would do.
""This can only exacerbate body image issues at a vulnerable time.""
Ms Collier's research will be presented at the Clinical Cosmetic and Reconstructive Expo in October.","Giving young people Botox treatment may restrict their emotional growth, experts warn.","people who want to look younger often want to look younger for a number of reasons, including to make themselves more attractive, British Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery","This is what the British Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery says, and this is also why they want to get younger, as a matter of fact,","“It is this which the British Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery explains: “and that is why they want to get younger,” says the British Society of",""" Then that's why they want to grow up,"" the British Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery says. ","And that's why people are so excited to get older,' the British Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery says. ","And that is why people are so excited about getting older,"" says the British Society of Plastic Surgery. ","a desire to look younger, the researchers said.

"The weapon was one of a pair of daggers discovered by British archaeologist Howard Carter in 1925 within the burial wrappings of the teenaged king.
The origin of its unrusted iron blade has baffled scientists because such metalwork was rare in ancient Egypt.
Tutankhamun was mummified more than 3,300 years ago.
Italian and Egyptian researchers used ""a non-invasive X-ray technique"" to confirm the composition of the iron without damaging it, according to a study published in the journal of Meteoritics and Planetary Science.

""Meteoritic iron is clearly indicated by the presence of a high percentage of nickel,"" the study's main author, Daniela Comelli, said.
The researchers say the presence of iron - along with levels of nickel and cobalt - ""strongly suggests an extraterrestrial origin"".
They compared the composition of the dagger to known meteorites within 2,000km around the Red Sea coast of Egypt, and found that one in particular - which landed 150 miles (240km) west of Alexandria - contained similar levels of nickel and cobalt.
Ancient Egyptians attached great significance to meteoritic iron for the production of fine ornamental or ceremonial objects, the researchers say.
""They were aware that these rare chunks of iron fell from the sky already in the 13th [Century] BCE, anticipating Western culture by more than two millennia,"" they write in their findings.
The high manufacturing quality of the blade in comparison with other simple-shaped meteoritic iron artefacts ""suggests a significant mastery of ironworking in Tutankhamun's time"", they say.
The dagger - which features a decorated gold handle and a gold sheath with a floral lily motif on one side and a feather pattern on the other - is now on display at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.

"For the first time, MPs have agreed in a vote that we will begin the process of leaving the EU by the end of March.
The government chief whip was seen with a massive grin after tonight's vote.
Remember ministers' climbdown came with a clever kicker, persuading Labour to sign up to their timetable for triggering Article 50 without committing to very much in return - the vague promise of a plan that could be as detailed as the back of the proverbial fag packet.
There's grumpiness on the Labour benches at how it was handled - angry conversations taking place, sources suggest - a sense among some that the front bench allowed themselves to be hoodwinked by the government's cunning plan.
Potential Tory rebels on the Remain side are deeply suspicious of the government's real intentions for giving more information about its ideas for Brexit. They backed off today, but will be back for more, no question.
But beyond the immediate machinations and the chief whip's big grin, two realities are confirmed by the events of the last 24 hours.
Yes - the numbers tonight suggest not very many MPs will actually try to block Brexit, or frustrate the process. They will certainly try to push the government for more details. They will certainly try to amend the proposals that eventually make it to the Commons, whenever that is. That could disrupt and delay things, but trying to stop it happening is not on the agenda of the vast majority.
But what's equally clear is that Theresa May does not have a secure majority on the EU. As soon as her plans (eventually) hit the floor of the House, she's likely to have to compromise.
That is precisely why the government is fighting so hard just across the road in the Supreme Court to try to avoid MPs having a say before the really hard work in Brussels even begins.",It sailed through.,523 to 122 to reject Labour's amendment which would have given MPs a say on whether the vote should be held by the end of this year,"1027, 122 to 122 to reject the amendment by which it was proposed that MPs should have the right to vote in this election.",“It was in opposition to the amendment which would have granted the MPs the right to vote in this election. ,‘It was in opposition to the amendment which would have allowed the MPs to vote in this election. ,That was in opposition to the amendment that would have allowed the MPs to vote in this election. ,‘That is opposed to the proposal which would have allowed the votes of the MPs to be cast in this election. ,"the government has agreed to begin the process of leaving the European Union by the end of March, following a vote by the House of Commons.
